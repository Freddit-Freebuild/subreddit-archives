I believe I reached Moderator later on in the server, Not sure. but pretty sure? I then moved to Admin, I was very excited, I promised myself to be as active as I can be. I also was a bit happy that Chris had a personality like me, so, I started acting immature times... I was an Admin for about 3 - 4 months? I'm not good with time haha, After those months, I got demoted down to Modmin, for being immature, ofc, Being my idiot self, I got salty xD (sorry for that by the way), Ever since then, I have been trying to be mature, It's better then the other times, trust me haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut anyway, off of that, I want to say how thankful I am to be on the server, and how happy I am for it to exist, Thank you Sven and Chris for making this server a thing, and having it to be where it is now.
