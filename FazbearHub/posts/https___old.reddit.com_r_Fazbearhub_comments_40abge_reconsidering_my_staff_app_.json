So far, I am the only previous staff member (that I know off) who has been denied staff. The reason for this was not being on that often, not paying attention to certain things, and \"being shit\". Now I know I have been gone for the paste few weeks, but that has simply been due to school. Some of my teachers are giving way too much homework, and we have midterms in less than a week. I haven't had the time to be on. Luckily, I have finally got MineChat too work, so I will be on much more frequently, even sometimes during school hours (PST). The next thing, paying attention, is something I have problems at, even at school. I have shorter than usual attention span, blanking out during the middle of class, subconsciously reading books while thinking of other things, I have to go back and reread things when I snap out of it. So it would be extremely easy for me to miss anything important going on in the fast moving chat, especially if Im building at the time. For the last thing, I completely understand. You think Im shit at my job, but when theirs 6 other staff members on, and most of them are higher up than you, its pretty much a race to who gets to do the deed first. I honestly think \"your shit\" isn't a valid reason for me not to be staff. If Im shit, than half the other staff you re-hired are shit as well. The reason Im making this post for you guys to reconsider, is because me, and other players on the server, think that its unfair. Unfair that people who have had almost no experience of being staff on anything, are made staff when others who have had 8 months of experience don't. I don't want to start any arguments on the server, but I just think you guys should reconsider this, for me, and for any other players who where previously staff but now aren't. Please reconsider,\n\n-Axe_Face",
