I would like to go Admin and here's my application!\n\n\nWhy I would like to be Admin: I want to make the server more fun and make it a better place by removing most of out drama that ends up in a huge fight or just pisses off players. I will use logic to solve most of your problems (If you listen to me for god's sake) we occur in Freddit. I am also eager to help players and other staff and enforce the rules here.\n\n\nWhen I will ban people: If I see somebody griefing I will ask them what they are doing. If it their build and their destroying it (without fire or lava) I can accept that. If they say something rude because they have no brain or make a bad excuse I will ban them until I see their ban appeal, If a user comes here to bully players and doesn't stop that will also be banned. I don't like griefing or bullying as it is a horrible feeling to go through and just isn't right. People are different and we should accept them.\n\n\nWhen I will tempban or kick: If a player is being quite rude for a while and has been here for a while so we trust them that should be a tempban. Kicking should be for spam or advertising. If a player that we trust or has been for a while decides to be rude to staff that should also be a tempban, if it continues a ban should go into affect. Staff are here to help the server, not to be insulted.\n\n\nHave I been banned before?: I've been banned once for spawn killing because some angry admin got killed. I also got a tempban for placing water on a globe which is called water griefing.\n\n\nWhy me?: I want to make Freddit a bettter place. A server with less drama and happy builders satisfied with the server. I also am a Moderator on the server and I want things to be done in a right and fair way.\n\nEDIT: Jay, don't even try putting drama in that comment section. I just applied, no harm here.\n\n\nEDIT: If we have too many Admins I'll just stay mod.",
