Freddit was born. Created by Chris, the server was targeted at Five Nights at Freddy's fans. People joined to play in a peaceful server. After some weeks gone by, Sven started to become a popular player.\n\nSlowly, everyone started picking sides. Some wanted Chris as the owner. Others wanted Sven as the owner.\n\nAfter several minor conflicts between Chris, Sven and Dante to win Freddit's Throne, a terrorist attack nearly kills Chris, but the attacker was never found. He concluded Sven and Dante must have had something to do with it when he saw how fast Sven climbed to Owner and Dante to President after the attack.\n\nSome say Pres tried to help Chris explain to Freddit what Sven and Dante really did, but when Dante is assassinated outside Orb's Diner, it is said Pres stopped helping Chris tell his story to the world.  \n\nThe Ownership War begins. In the beggining, there was no actual confrontation: Chris went into hiding after Dante's assassination in the nearby server Xeon. There, it is said he murdered the owner of Xeon and raised his own army.\n\nThe mystery around the terrorist attack, Dante's assassination and Chris' dissappearence makes the Freddittors tell the tale differently, some say Sven and Dante weren't responsible for the terrorist attack, some say Chris didn't kill Dante.\n\nUntil one day, Chris invades Camp Nures, destroying everything and pillaging. When Sven was noticed, his army went forward to battle, trying to stop Chris from destroying anything else, using dreadful weapons and ships. The sailors on the flying ships, after the battle, dissappeared. The Air-Ship Project was the final nail in the coffin, and the Xeon Army had no chance against the Freddit Army. They were wiped out.\n\n---\n\n**Chris was defeated**, once again. He had lost yet another battle against Sven.\n\n#Chapter I\n\n---\n\n-- Did you like the story?\n\n-- Yeah it was cool. So Chris never attacked again, Zoo?\n\n-- Well we're still here. That means something right?\n\n-- I kinda want to see Xeon now.\n\n-- Don't even think about it, Arab. You know Chris is going to cut your throat once he sees you there.\n\n-- I guess you're right... I have a question though. Are we still at war?\n\n-- I mean... Technically yes. Chris isn't doing any offensive moves, but you can call this war.\n\n-- Woah... We're at war with another server.\n\n-- Yeah. It's kinda weird saying out loud, isn't it?\n\n-- Yeah. One more thing, what did Chris really do?\n\n-- Hm... I mean, he attacked the server.\n\n-- After losing it, sure. I think he just wanted to reclaim what was his.\n\n-- But now it's gone, Arab. Sven is the Owner of Freddit.\n\n-- Oh and what happened to Camp Nures after the battle?\n\n-- It's now a wasteland. Some say it's even worse than the Banlands, but I went there and, although it's destroyed completly, it's not that bad. You can talk to Pres, he was thinking of rebuilding it.\n\n-- Ok, thanks Zoo.\n\nI know what I'm building. And Pluff does too. He knows that the machine can't fall under wrong hands. We just need Sven's approval for the Console logs.\n\nOnce we upload the Console logs to the Machine, a new era for Freddit beggins. It will detect weird behaviour on people and alert possible future griefers, hackers and raiders.\n\nMe and Pluff know the magnitude of this. The Machine can pretty much predict the future based on the past, but there cannot be any flaws.\n\n-- Zoo!\n\nI hear someone. I think it's pres.\n\n-- Oh pres! What are you doing here?\n\n-- Sven asked me to tell you that you and Pluff will have a meeting to get the Console logs.\n\n-- Wait what?!\n\nI can't believe this.\n\n-- Are you serious?\n\n-- I'm not joking. Guess your little machine was enough to capture his attention.\n\nLittle machine. It's the Machine.\n\n-- Anyways, he'll decide if he'll give you the logs tomorrow morning.\n\n-- Alright! See you, Pres.\n\nFinnally, the Console logs. The Machine will go online tomorrow as soon as I get them. This is good news. Let's see if it predicts any bad guys off the bat.\n\nI'll tell Pluff when I get to him. We're in the future, now. I better be prepared.\n\n---\n\n#[Chapter II](https://redd.it/3w9325)",
