I just want to share my thoughts on how it could go next time. Also, I won't share any plot details in the event.    \n\nNow, for my thoughts.  \n\nStarting off with the good, this roleplay of camp was actually really entertaining. Although it was cliche at some parts, it was still really fun, although some people didn't seem to get into it completely. Also, the camp looked really fantastic. The details around the camp seemed really nice, for example, I liked the little reference to Homura with HomTech.    \nBut now with some things that could be improved: Any time I saw this event, I saw it advertised for 10/24/2015 constantly. But it was done today? I'm guessing this was a test run, but I don't know, it's just weird and I'm kind of picky. Another thing: The reloads. Yes, I understand that this event just so happened to coincide with POC buying MultiCraft, but it really broke the tension. In general, this event could have been planned better.    \nJust some other things too, the teasers used to advertise these events (such as the MY SOUL IS CORRUPT poster you can see in spawn) didn't really fit in with anything about the event. Hopefully, this was actually just something not discussed due to the event just cancelling.   \nBut finally, the big thing that caused it to fail: Lack of coordination. I understand that staff probably did work hard to coordinate this event, but it seems that they didn't prepare for everything. A lot of camp seemed more or less walking around the campsite and then going to sleep. Then waking up, then going to sleep, listening to a really long monologue, and then something happens. People weren't also listening to staff, which would have been planned for.   \nThere's more that was good and bad about this event, but I think that these suggestions could bring out the potential this event could have. I believe this could be a great event, it just needs some more thought. Thanks for reading!",
