This is going to happen soon! We need to warn Sven about this!\n\n-- Could it have glitched? I mean... Nuclear devastation?\n\n-- Coming for us. From Chris. We need to be prepared if this is not a glitch! -- I said.\n\nMe and Pluff start heading towards the Staff HQ. We need to warn Sven about this. Freddit is in danger, and we need to do something about it.\n\nWe burst through the door. They were having a meeting, we didn't care.\n\n---\n\n-- Sven! The machine detected a threat!\n\n-- We're in the middle of a meeting, Zoo. -- Sven said -- If you would excuse us, I'll talk to you later.\n\n-- No, no, no! You don't get it: It's a nuclear event! -- Pluff shouted. -- Freddit can be wiped out of existence!\n\nSven got up from his chair. He looked at us, serious. He looked at Stick, then at Ryan and then at Hom.\n\n-- Get the others. -- He ordered.\n\n-- Sven, the Machine said that it had 100% accuracy. We didn't even know it was possible to have an 100% accuracy event.\n\n-- This is happening. -- Pluff said. -- Chris is bombing us.\n\n-- When? When did the machine said Chris would attack?!\n\n-- She didn't know.\n\n-- What?! I thought the Machine was reliable, Zoo! And she doesn't know when this is happening?!\n\n-- Sven, the Machine can't predict full human behaviour. We don't know when it's goin--\n\n-- Shut up, Pluff! -- Sven demanded. -- I can't trust your little machine.\n\nIt's not a little machine, Sven. It's the Machine. Don't underestimate the Machine. Does he really not believe in her?!\n\n-- I'm not going to trust a malfunctioning machine. Talk to me when you have REAL proof.\n\n-- Sven it's not malfunctioning! -- I said. -- The Machine picked up the threat milliseconds after it's start up!\n\n-- That's why it's a glitch, Zoo. Now get out.\n\n---\n\n-- Well that sucked. Goddamn, I don't even know what to do. Maybe he's right. Can we have a quick snack over at Orb's Diner?\n\n-- You know he's wrong, Pluff.\n\n-- Orders are orders. If Sven told us to get more evidence then we should.\n\n-- How?! -- I stopped walking. -- How are we supposed to do that?! The Machine did that for us!\n\n-- And it didn't tell us when.\n\n-- We can still do something. -- I hesitated, but said it anyways. -- You know we have some money left. We didn't need all the money they gave us, and we still got millions left.\n\n-- What are you saying? -- Pluff asked.\n\n-- We can still save Freddit from the nuclear attacks. Sven doesn't believe us, but we're still free to do whatever we like.\n\n-- I'm confused. What do you want to do, Zoo?\n\n-- Protect everyone, basically. That's why we built the Machine. I'm suggesting building infrastructures to protect the population from the nuclear attack.\n\n-- Like shelters?\n\n-- Exactly. -- I said. -- Exactly like shelters.\n\n---\n\n#To be continued.",
