#The Fallout of Freddit - Season 1                     
Alright. Let's do this. The Fallout of Freddit, Season 1. WARNING: Before you read, you should know that this is only my opinion, so please don't get TRIGGERED. Alright, here we go.
**Plot**            
The plot of this season is...Chris is going to bomb Freddit, which we all know he eventually will, considering the title of the comic, The Fallout of Freddit. In the mean time, the first half of the season had some nice lines, but the thing is, there's a lack of action scenes, which can make it seem slightly dull. I don't have time to type everything that happens, so here! Have a tl;dr of the first TFOF by Zoo!
**PILOT**: The comic series begins with Zoo and Arab. Zoo tells Arab about the constant state of war Freddit is in, and he starts to reveal the cruel world they live in. The readers learn that the timeline of the comic separates from the normal timeline of Freddit when a terrorist attack nearly kills Chris. The real terrorrist was never found, but Sven and Dante were frequently tied up with the attack, so Chris assassinates Dante outside Orb's Diner. The Ownership War begins, as Chris and Sven fight for the throne of Freddit. The reader is also introduced to the Machine, an AI designed by Pluff and Zoo which could detect criminals and griefers before they attack.                
**THE MACHINE**: Pluff and Zoo convince Sven on giving the logs, the final nail in the coffin for the Machine to work, to them. Seven milliseconds after the logs instalation, a nuclear attack warning pops up: Chris was going to bomb Freddit.                                   
**VAULT-TEC**: After an unsuccesseful attempt at warning Sven about the imminent attack, Zoo and Pluff use the leftover money from the Machine Project to start Vault-Tec and build underground shelters for people to survive the nuclear attack.                             
**SECRETS**: As Zoo and Pluff start building Vault 87 and Vault Z, the original vaults, Dave, a spy working for Sven, reports what Zoo and Pluff were building. Nue comes up with a strategy for Sven to buy Vault-Tec: Zoo and Pluff were broke, so Sven could buy Vault-Tec and use it to build more Vaults. The spy is killed by Nue.                                
**THE MEETING** The Staff assemble and discuss Vault-Tec's future. Sven decides to buy it, but he says he has other plans. Pres concludes his study on Inter-Dimensional Travelling of Dr. William (someone we meet later on) and re-discovers Null, a weird dimension.                               
**NULL**: Pres discusses with Sven if he should explore Null, and decides he will. Meanwhile, a warning pops up from the Machine that YungPvP was going to grief spawn on 21st of November (the day he actually griefed spawn in normal Freddit). As Pres explores Null, he finds a mysterious man whose powers over Null are greater than Pres would have imagined at the time. Pres aborts the mission when the mistery man dissappears.                      
**THE X-NUKE**: Pres exits out of Null and spends a night at Dry's home. Dry speaks of his former room mate, Nathan, who died in the Ownership War. Meanwhile, Sven is introduced to Nuka-X or the X-Nuke, the most powerful weapon Freddit has designed yet. As things start looking better for Sven and the Freddittors, Chris appears out of the Null portal and heads towards Mega's Lab.                                 
**IT ENDS NOW**: Sven locks Chris in the Extermination Chamber, and slowly everyone from Freddit goes to Mega's Lab. But the fact that the Machine still didnt update her prevision about Chris attacking Freddit raises doubts around the Machine. Zoo and Pluff know something was wrong and the Machine didnt have a glitch. Ubi, Will and Ryan apprehend Yung, and he bleeds out at Staff's HQ. Sven tells Orb to start preparing the X-Nuke to wipe out Xeon and end the Ownership War.                           
**THE FALLOUT**: The Freddittors debate about warning Xeon players about the X-Nuke, but Sven seems to start becoming insane and obcessed with destroying everything Chris built. As the steps of activation of the X-Nuke unfold, the Machine changes the suspect to undefined, and when the final countdown begins it changes to Sven: The X-Nuke had a virus planted by Chris and the location changed from Xeon to Freddit without Orb knowing. The Freddittors run for the vaults as the nuclear bombs fall on Freddit. Spurr's body is smashed by Vault 83's Door, Pres hides in Null and the others go to Vaults.
Well. The final episodes were quite action-packed, weren't they? Let's do our analysis.
*Questionable Details*                       
How did Chris know about Null, considering he used it to get it to Mega's Lab? When did [THIS ONE take place? Does it count as an episode? Why did Chris shoot Yung considering he's his best friend? And most importantly, WHY does Chris look like Darth Vader??](http://imgur.com/a/5crZF)
**Game References**
**NUKA**-x, which is a reference to Fallout's Nuka-Cola. Hell, that's what I think at least.
**Most Memorable Chapter-Ending**
The penultimate episode, It Ends Now. Sven goes insane and demands Freddit fire the nuke to destroy an entire server.
**Most Unmemorable Ending**
Eh...I guess it was inevitable and obvious Freddit was gonna become a nuclear apocalypse anyway, so The Fallout, the season finale. On the other hand, it DOES look like The Machine's up to something..
**Conclusions**
Despite the slow start TFOF has, it gradually builds and builds later on, until it literally blows up! The Fallout of Freddit's first season is an enjoyable experience and it is clear that it will be missed when the final chapter is released.
Just two more.
