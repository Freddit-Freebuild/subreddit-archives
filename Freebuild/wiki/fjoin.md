Welcome to the best guide of Freddit Freebuild ever, a place where salt is born and where drama happens every day.  
Feel free to pick up some popcorn before you join the server as it will be a heck of a ride, remember to stay in your seats though ;).  
Upon joining Freddit you're greeted by ~~salt~~ our players, dont mind the chat though as drama may occur ofcourse!  
So you're on Freddit now what are you're going to do next?  
  
**Step #1 ~~Ask for Staff and say you're a PMC Moderator~~ Build!**  
Ofcourse you're online on the server and the first thing that will happen is that you will be greeted by all players.  
~~Quickly do you realise its a salty drama fest in the chat, as I told you above having some popcorn is handy to enjoy the drama as much as the Owners of Freddit do!~~  
You need to build to "Rank Up" on our server to get more permissions and to use handy tools like WorldEdit!  
Dont forget to read the rules though by using /rules you should always especially follow rule 8.

**Step #2 Done**  
Actually that is all, you'll learn all about Freddit in your first few days of joining, dont be scared to ask for help and have fun.
