# THE RULES
*Last revision: 29th August 2018*

## Community guidelines

**[1]** Don't be disrespectful towards anyone, and don't be an annoyance.    
Please be aware of the damage you're doing - what you might find ok others might find it harmful. This includes mocking someone for something they're not okay with being made fun of for, and bringing people down due to old drama, for example.


**[2]** If you're told you're being annoying in regards to anything and you're asked to stop, stop.  
This rule isn't valid in all cases (example: to say someone's opinion is annoying to shut them up). It relates more to a user's behaviour.


**[3]** We do not tolerate discrimination.   
Refrain from racism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia, etc please. "Freedom of speech" does not protect you from us banning you if necessary.


**[4]** Please refrain some provocative discussions outside of the nsfw category.   
If you're asked to move to a more appropriate channel, please do so.


**[5]** Do not leak anyone's private information.   
This includes the person's real name. Make sure you have the relevant person's consent before sharing information like that.
Note: Staff is allowed to punish you if deemed necessary if you're caught doxing a person/trying to harm them with their real life information, even outside of the server.


**[6]** Dicussions can get worked up - so, please use logic and reasoning and solid arguments to back up your statements in a discussion  (https://www.reddit.com/r/Freebuild/comments/5uie4f/philosophy_is_the_answer/ )   
Disrespecting and insulting on a drama event/on an argument/discussion is worse than normal insulting and disrespecting, as it makes a tense situation go off the rails easily. So don't do it. 
The linked Reddit post by Zoo is a good introduction to peaceful debating. It's important to keep your calm during discussions -your presentation affects how others perceive your arguments.


**[7]** Please do not leave this server as a joke.   
It's annoying when staff members have to constantly reassign your roles. If staff thinks you're leaving the server as a joke too often, they can ban your for whatever length they deem appropriate (i.e. 2 up to 5 days)


**[8]** Do not provoke/agitate other users on purpose.  


**[9]** Breaking a rule by ignorance is still breaking a rule.  
"I wasn't aware of that rule/I didn't know" is not an excuse - please read all the rules.

**[10]** You are allowed to advertise your own/other small communities here, but staff is allowed to refrain you from doing so if they feel you're doing this for advertisement's sake.

## Minecraft-specific rules

**[1]** Do not edit terrain within another user's build without their consent.   
Community builds (e.g. rpcity, the wasteland) function based upon how their governing bodies decide (of course under staff's supervision). If you build in one of the following locations, you consent to the respective leading group's right to move (NOT modify) your build:

- /warp rpcity: @rpcity-council on the Discord server (MAIN SUPERVISOR: DedicatedGraph)  
- /warp wasteland: @wasteland-council on the Discord server (MAIN SUPERVISOR: Zoocanadanda)  
Ask each community build's main supervisor if you want to join the project's leading team.

**[2]** No public nudity in builds/maps allowed. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246038374668828683/302180736163643394/ayyboisplayybois.txt  
Private/remote located NSFW builds will be or wont be granted permission based on Staff's judgements about the build, contact Staff first.
 Refer to the linked .txt file if you ever happen to stumble upon an ayyboi (unlikely, but just in case).

**[3]** Don't submit the same build twice for rankups.

**[4]** Don't harm the server,  its functionalities, or the community on purpose.  
This ranges from building lag clocks with redstone to using worldedit to crash the server entirely.

**[5]** World-downloading is not allowed.  
You are free to request a schematic of your build from a staff member, or even an entire world save in specific cases.

## Additional info

- Remember that the Discord & Community rules apply to the Minecraft server. Same vice versa (even though this makes 0 sense, but JUST in case).
- You have the right to disobey staff/the rules, but staff has the right to punish you for this however deemed fitting.
- If you feel like a staff member has treated you/someone else's case unfairly, contact one of the owners over Discord dms or send an anonymous complaint report (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctPJiy0CStrSsiJRi2NTSEyEX1mUoifAf64oWYY4p8Rs7tUg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
- To maintain at least some order, try sticking to the channel best suited for what you want to discuss. We're not specifically enforcing this, but if you're asked to move from a main chat multiple times, please consider this.
- Staff has the right to give you a "time out" ban if they feel this is necessary in your case (in relation to rule 2).
- If you're caught breaking the rules in relation to Freddit outside of this Discord or the Minecraft server, staff has the right to take action if deemed necessary for the protection of this server and its users.
- Staff can't punish you for breaking rules before they exist (i.e. if they establish a rule regarding something you did, they can't retroactively punish you for this.)
- Your #fredditchat access can be revoked as a precautionary action if staff feels it's needed (for example: spam, posting nsfw, irritating other users despite being asked to stop)
- If staff feels you can't respond to their requests in a mature way, they have the right to take action however deemed necessary (example: avoiding replying to their questions through joking multiple times)
- It's perfectly fine to want to investigate something for staff (as long as this sticks to the rules of course), but if another staff member is online and they're dealing with something, let them do their job. Don't do backseat-moderating.
This is applicable in both minecraft griefs and drama situations (especially for the latter. Don't get yourself involved in a heated argument if a staff member is working on putting out the fire.)
