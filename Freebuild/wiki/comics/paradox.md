Paradox (also originally known as Freddit: Paradox) is a miniseries documenting a time travel adventure around Freddit. A time machine test session goes horribly wrong as Psy arrives in the future, discovering a threat to the server. The only way to help fix it is to gather Fredditors from all time periods, to build something huge.
