For starters, today earlier Ballonz made an alt after I thaught him how to do it and it came online. As a joke, I opped his alt and made it owner, and made it ban myself because I had to pee, so I banned myself and didn't unban.\n\nWhen I return from my peeing session, apparently hell broke loose because Ballonz also banned himself so they thaught the alt was taking over the server and people were quote \"terrified\" of what would happen. Even after explaining it was a simple joke some people were still angry but eventually it died down (luckily) and we moved on.\n\nThen, hours later you come with an alt, and you make yourself OP and owner like the past situation, even claiming you're Waving. I told you, this started drama earlier, and to not to do it. We talked about some things I will mention here in this post and then you left.\n\nThen you came back in another alt. I mean, what the hell. Why can't you just use a normal fucking account to play? I can think of reasons to use alts on Freddit, believe me, but to waste your time pretending you're taking over is just... so pointless. And as I mentioned today it started drama with me and Ballonz you shouldnt do it, but you did it anyways again. (You told Ballonz it was you on that alt, but you didnt tell anyone else).\n\nY'know, you'd think ownering Freddit would be a hard job, since it's a literal hell hole, but I dont think you are even trying. I mean, you have a prefix of owner, op, all perms and console. You have control over everything, you're the only owner of Freddit. There's ranks that have permissions broken. Or incomplete/inconsitent.\n\nAlmost everytime you're online, you're afk, then you come back you say the nutshack song then you go afk again. This happens like what, 80% of the time. And that's when you're online.\n\nBeing owner is being the ultimate staff. You're supposed to look over your server like it's your sheeple, and fix things that are broken like perms, config problems, that AFK-Idle kick after 5 minutes, rogue plugins, and overall just be a staff like the other.\n\nThere's a misconception that once you reach Owner you can relax, that the other staff will do the work for you. Some days ago you asked me to add the getbanners perms to a rank I dont even remember what. Why couldn't you do it, for example? I even added perms for you when I wasnt even staff, months ago.\n\nThere's so much stuff to do as owner, and the fact that you have to ask what to do shows to me you aren't doing your job properly. Try to be more active in your community. Heck, why not a build competition? Or a contest on the sub? Even asking for suggestions/if there's something wrong on chat is enough. Try to help the staff on the server. Even instruct some staff on staff commands. Help some users that need help. Seek good plugins/improvements that will benefit the server. Rollback griefs and such. Help this community stay alive and well.\n\nI'm not even going to list all the things on how to do your job, because if I had to tell you how to do your job, Manager should be above Owner, because it's the exact opposite that should happen on a normal server.\n\n---\n\nThis post was posted on the sub but then I removed it because some users feared it might cause drama.
