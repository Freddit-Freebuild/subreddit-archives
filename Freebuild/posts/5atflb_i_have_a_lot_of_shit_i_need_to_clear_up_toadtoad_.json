I'll do my best to explain here, But I still don't expect anybody to understand or not react with anger that will probably result in me receiving the ban hammer, and getting demoted from Mod. \n\nY'see, Back when I first joined Freddit (Back when Poko was still an owner, Orb was still a mod, Waving wasn't shit yet, Y'know) It went pretty well for the first few days. Then somebody (I think it might've been JAFC) Actually asked me how old I was due to the numbers in my username (Because I have a pretty cringe username I'll admit, But in fairness I've had it sence I was a major cringelord, 12). Now, Here's me thinking \"Oh shit, This is probably some sort of mature 18+ server, Uh, What do I say\" and then, for whatever reason, Thought that 18 (It turned to 19 when I celebrated my birthday earlier this year.) was a good answer. And people bought it. I came up with the things about tech support because that seems like it'd be the kinda job I'd actually do IRL. So for awhile it was working, But then I was talking with JAFC over steam, and he asked me where I worked. I came up with that company that's really an internet company because it sounded believeable that they'd have some sort of tech support program, even if they didn't list it. My lie would become paper thin with the research, Then JAFC or somebody else would start questioning me, then they'd get mad and it'd cause unnessacary shit. So I'll just end this now.\n\n1. I'm not 19, I'm only 15.\n2. I HAVE had a job, but it was only for about 2 months, I actually quit earlier in october.\n3. I don't live alone, I live with my mom and my brother.\n4. I should've been honest from the start. And I'm sorry.\n\nI accept that I'll probably be banned from Freddit for being dishonest, and lose everybody here as a freind. But I'm willing to face this, After all, It was only a matter of time before JAFC or Woger or Psy or whoever, found out.\n\nSeriously, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have kept this up so long.\n\n-Toad \"Circus Bonnie\" Toad",
