This is pretty much a fact that he has done some bad shit and has been afk too long multiple times in the past.\n\nWhen RR was becoming popular, I told JAFC to wake the fuck up and start maintaining and improving the server instead of being an afk asshole he was being at the time. That time when he did listen, the community pretty much got back on his feet again instead of being split up (apart from some users, we all decided that anyone can join whichever server they want was a good idea).\n\nNow this is the behind the scenes. Toad, a long time ago, was promoted to mod. We had a staff application and we were thinking who it should be. Suddenly, without warning, he was the one picked. JAFC didnt consider the staff's opinion and its obvious I talked to him about it, how he should ask staff about our opinions. He apologized and we moved on.\n\nThen he does the same shit again, this time promotes Axe to _manager_. Without telling anyone, without asking anyone, I join in and he's manager. Again, JAFC didnt ask for opinions or better suggestions, and Axe is a good manager, but he shouldve warned us.\n\nThen Staff System 2. He asked me before hand, which was good. We talked about it, talked what the ranks should be, all neat until I go to the subreddit and bam, _staff application megathread_. And I read \"**all staff have been demoted**\". I check server and its true.\n\nHe does a fucking _staff wipe_ without even telling me. I immediatly talked to him about it. This is not a minor promotion of a guy this is a demotion of all staff including the good ones we had to fucking hero. And leaves Zen as manager because logic.\n\nSo I talked to him again. And other things prior to it, for example when Woger was editting faz's town, Spurr was warning JAFC about it (it was a logic thing to do, btw woger and faz have their shit worked out now), this happened: http://pastebin.com/umhiSv4a .\n\nAll of this I addressed over the weeks. Told him to improve and told him to stop doing stuff like that.\n\n---\n\n**Until today this happened**.\n\nA bit of backstory: when the Ayybois got banned, I censored all my builds like JAFC told me to. But I had the maps on my enderchest, inside a NBT chest (a chest with items that once you place down they  appear like an enderchest/backpack). This chest labeled \"enderchest2\" was made because my normal enderchest was full, so i used that chest to put the other things.\n\nIncluding the ayyboi maps. But, once you place the NBT chest down, anyone can open it. So I placed it on T.B.C. World, hidden from users because i dont want people to open my private enderchest (which JAFC did, considering I had a private lockette sign). He broke my [Private] chest, opened it and saw the maps.\n\nHere's the thing, the map were purged. Anyone with the ayyboi maps lost them: they're blank. So no ayyboi was there, just a blank map labeled as so (there wasnt even a girl drawn in the maps, just a blank one.).\n\nSo this conversation started: http://pastebin.com/MivifJf2\n\nAnd this is why I was demoted from owner. I truly did my best efforts to try to make this a better place, and I added plugins like WordScramble or /heads and made configs and fixed perms and overall tried to do the best I can, but I'm being demoted because I have different opinions than JAFC.\n\nFarewell,\n\n- Zoo Man",
