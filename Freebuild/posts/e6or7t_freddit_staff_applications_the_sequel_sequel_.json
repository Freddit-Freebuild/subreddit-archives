World RP has finally ended, Freddit has convinced an Indian journalist that global cooling is real and that we are going to get Donald Trump impeached and take over the world (we're not, go away NSA), Half Life 3 has been announced, and Sans is in Smash. But we STILL don't have any new staff members. (We're down to 6!) Let's change that!\n\nYou all know what to do by now; anyone not banned is able to apply and is eligible for staff. Current staff members can apply to be promoted (though well preforming staff members will likely be promoted internally anyway.) We'd like as many applicants as possible, so apply even if you aren't sure! (Just remember that staff does require a reasonable level of activity.) **All applications will be read and considered** even if you were not chosen for staff. After the results are announced and if you don't make it, if you would like to contact a staff member and ask why your application wasn't accepted, feel free to do so.\n\nApply using the format below:\n\n**Username:Alias (which name/nickname (Not username) are you most known for?):Age:Staff rank you're aiming for (This is just your suggestion, you can get a different rank than you were aiming for):Future activity (How active you'll be in the near future):Prior experience:Notable skills:What are your plans for when you become staff?:In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand? (You will be trained upon promotion, so don't worry if you don't know any Minecraft staff  commands.):Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):**\n\nIf you're unsure of what's expected from you at each notch on the totem pole, please consult the [T.B.C.Staff Reform Act, 5th November 2018](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/257622239023726592/516267693234585611/STAFF_REFORM_PROJECT.pdf).\n\nA good strategy for this application is actually downvoting other people's applications to get yours on top. (A strategy for ensuring that your application will be immediately discarded and making Freddit very dissapointed in you, that is!)\n\n**Good luck!** The server could do with some fresh hands.",

I don't expect to get anything higher.  \n**Future activity (How active you'll be in the near future):** I see myself as a pretty active member of the community, I'm usually there in an instant when you ping me. Sometimes though, I will have to go help my parents with something, or go take my dog outside, and when I do, I'll usually say so beforehand.   \n**Prior experience:** I was helper previously around February earlier this year.  \n**Notable skills:** I'm pretty good with assigning/creating roles in Discord, I'm very competent with worldedit, I know how to rollback, CO:I, kick, ban, broadcast, and pretty much any basic command you'd need as a staff member.   \n**What are your plans for when you become staff?:** Same as everyone else, make the community a better place. I really want to push for a role bot to be added to the discord, since it'd make things a lot easier when it comes to assigning roles.  \n**In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:** I definitely feel that my activity on this community could greatly help the staff team, oh and also the roll bot.  \n**What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand? (You will be trained upon promotion, so don't worry if you don't know any Minecraft staff commands.):** Kick, ban, co:i, rollback, broadcast, vanish, pretty much everything when it comes to worldedit, and waving taught me that deleting worlds command too.  \n**Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):** There's a lot that I want to do to help this community, and I can't really do a whole lot as a regular user. Of course I'll regulate myself as needed, but you get the picture. I'd love to have my input on certain things, and I already pretty much know the ropes.  \nMy last staff app, I was constanly pushing for the results to be released, that was selfish of me, and I'm sorry.

I don&amp;#39;t expect to get anything higher.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Future activity (How active you&amp;#39;ll be in the near future):&lt;/strong&gt; I see myself as a pretty active member of the community, I&amp;#39;m usually there in an instant when you ping me. Sometimes though, I will have to go help my parents with something, or go take my dog outside, and when I do, I&amp;#39;ll usually say so beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Prior experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I was helper previously around February earlier this year.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Notable skills:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m pretty good with assigning/creating roles in Discord, I&amp;#39;m very competent with worldedit, I know how to rollback, CO:I, kick, ban, broadcast, and pretty much any basic command you&amp;#39;d need as a staff member.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; Same as everyone else, make the community a better place. I really want to push for a role bot to be added to the discord, since it&amp;#39;d make things a lot easier when it comes to assigning roles.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; I definitely feel that my activity on this community could greatly help the staff team, oh and also the roll bot.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand? (You will be trained upon promotion, so don&amp;#39;t worry if you don&amp;#39;t know any Minecraft staff commands.):&lt;/strong&gt; Kick, ban, co:i, rollback, broadcast, vanish, pretty much everything when it comes to worldedit, and waving taught me that deleting worlds command too.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;#39;s a lot that I want to do to help this community, and I can&amp;#39;t really do a whole lot as a regular user. Of course I&amp;#39;ll regulate myself as needed, but you get the picture. I&amp;#39;d love to have my input on certain things, and I already pretty much know the ropes.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy last staff app, I was constanly pushing for the results to be released, that was selfish of me, and I&amp;#39;m sorry. I won&amp;#39;t make the same mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
