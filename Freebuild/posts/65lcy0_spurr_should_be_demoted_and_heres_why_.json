I'm just here to say why I personally think Spurr is a bad staff member. To Spurr: please don't blindly comment on this post about why I have no rights to say something, or why this is just evil or blah blah blah. If you want to comment on this post, which you probably do, mention on why a point I bring up is wrong. Anyway, enjoy.\n\n\n\n1. **Grudges.**\n\n\nLet's say someone comes in and brings up a point. Let's use **Pope** as a example. Pope comes and says that he didn't do anything with the takeover. He explains that he has no logs due to him being in a voice-chat. Instead of giving Pope the benefit of the doubt, or even listening to him, Spurr automatically says he's guilty due to a grudge from believing he assisted in it. This is a problem because when you're deciding if someone should be unbanned, Spurr will automatically say 'no', and instead of listening to the reasons why they SHOULD be unbanned, he only listens to what they did BEFORE. \n\n\n\n\n2. **Downvoting.**\n\n\nSpurr downvotes anything he personally doesn't like. The thing that is confusing about this is that [he asks people not to downvote things, too/](http://prntscr.com/eww0yo) This may seem like a problem to you, maybe not, but it's still something worth bringing up. \n\n\n\n\n3. **Ego.**\n\nSince he became staff, Spurr seems to have gotten a very large ego. He acts like he's always in charge, and acts like he's the main authority on bans too. Egos are never a good thing.\n\n\n4. **Ending.**\n\n\nLook, Spurr isn't a terrible person. He's a cool guy (he is made of ice cream after all), but these are problems. Please don't just come here and bash me and say I'm a bad person. Please look at what I said in this post and think about it.\n\n\nok bye\n\n\n",
