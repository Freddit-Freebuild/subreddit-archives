I've been working really hard, and I think I've managed to find out some more stuff about the bots! My team has finally done some progress!\n\n**Zoo _(focused and turns around)_**: What did you find?\n\n**Steam**: Another voice command hidden on the legs of the B-7 model! If we say the right words, any B-7 model will start working faster. I forgot the words, but once you say it, it starts going really fast. The only problem is the bot usually slams himself to a wall.\n\n**Zoo _(looks out the window)_**: A voice command?\n\n**Steam**: Yeah! Which makes the Robotic Appliances model B-7 run way, way faster than the default settings!\n\n**Zoo**: Steam. This is not what I call progress. I mean, what do you want to do with this?\n\n**Steam**: Well you and the Counsil are the ones who call the shots but... Maybe we can start manufactoring bots for the entertainment industry. Race Bots will go wild and we will get richer!\n\n**Zoo**: Richer? _(looks down and smiles)_ But... What for? To get a few laughs out of it, to watch robots run and see which one wins? And to gamble? It isn't enough. It's not about getting a few laughs here and there... _(looks out the window)_ No. We need more than that.\n\n**Steam**: There is a way, boss, to get the real deal.\n\n**Zoo _(while looking out the window, smiling)_**: Yeah?\n\n**Steam**: Dream World. The damn place has been open for what 10, 11 years? And nobody got a single bot out of there. Out here in the real world... Anyone can cut open a bot and try to figure out how it works.\n\n**Zoo**: But they fail.\n\n**Steam**: The bots who are distributed to the public, they're meant to be fortresses. I mean, all the Robotic Appliances we bought in the last weeks always erased their core heuristics before we could even open the damn thing.\n\n**Zoo _(turns around, walks toward Steam)_**: But on Dream World, the robots are always being cut open, killed or imprisioned. That's why it exists, to live without limits. You can do whatever you want to the bots, including cutting open one and taking out its guts, if that satisfies you.\n\n**Steam _(a little frightened)_**: I guess.\n\n**Zoo _(smiles after seeing Steam got a bit scared)_**: Because those events happen too often, self-destruction everytime someone cut open a bot would be insane. Instead, nobody can bring eletronic devices to Dream World to inspect the bots. All they see is their... Motor parts.\n\n**Steam _(surprised)_**: Wow. I'm guessing you already thought of my idea before I came in here.\n\n**Zoo**: Going to Dream World to figure out how they work. Possibly steal one of them. Improve them.\n\n**Steam _(uplifted)_**: And then mass manufacture and selling them! Getting richer and making T.B.C. even bigger in the proccess!\n\n**Zoo _(expression of disapproval, looks out the window)_**: Is that what you want to do?\n\n**Steam**: Isn't that the whole point of R.A.I.D.?\n\n**Zoo**: What an unfortunate series of letters. Your department's name is picked by the first letters of each word, as you know, but it has nothing to do with raiding. We'd improve the bots and we would partner up with Dr. Orb.\n\n**Steam**: Dr. Orb? Zoo, Dr. Orb probably hasn't seen the light of day in years. He stays in his place, building and improving robotic appliances. The dude is insane, he's lonely and he's talking to god damn bots. I'm sorry, but I prefer human interaction much more than a bucket of bolts that cooks my food and washes my clothes.\n\n**Zoo _(laughs)_**: You've never been to Dream World! Ha, I didn't know that.\n\n**Steam _(confused)_**: I'm sorry, but... Well, yeah you're right, I haven't, but what does that have to do with anything?\n\n**Zoo**: Dream World is a special place. The bots that are used outside Dream World, the ones who do chores, cook your food, make your bed, hell, even have sex with you if you want to, are a lot different from the robots in Dream World. They're... They're the closest thing to a human that is fabricated. They feel... lifelike.\n\n**Steam**: Yeah, yeah. What's so special about Dream World? It's just a dang place with bots where you can go pretend to be someone you're not. Shoot a couple of people, or be the hero who saves the day.\n\n**Zoo _(smiling)_**: It's beautiful how wrong you are. You don't pretend in Dream World, you let go. You stop pretending you're what you are here, to be what you have always wanted to be. Your true self.\n\n**Steam**: Yeah, I just don't see the point of it. Spend a shit ton of money there to what, shoot or fuck a couple of bots? The latter you can do in the real world! And why would you want to shoot bots?\n\n**Zoo**: I'm buying you a ticket.\n\n**Steam**: What?\n\n**Zoo**: You're going to Dream World. You're going to come back after your crazy week, you're going to be all sad that it's over, you'll be thanking me for the rest of your life for buying you a ticket, and then I'm going to buy you another ticket. Then you will be more calm, and you will focus more on your job there.\n\n**Steam**: Which is?\n\n**Zoo**: Finding how the damn robots work.\n\n**Steam**: I'll be sure to pack my bags, boss.\n\n**Zoo _(laughing)_**: Bags? Hahaha, you're not taking anything with you, Steam. Dream World is a world like ours. It is made, fabricated, yes, and everything has a deeper meaning or moral dillema to it but... I'm pretty sure there's food.\n\n**Steam**: Where do I sleep?\n\n**Zoo**: You take one blanket and lay it on the ground, you sleep there.\n\n**Steam**: What?\n\n**Zoo _(puts hand on Steam's shoulder)_**: I'm joking. You'll know. It's just like our world, Steam. There's houses, hotels, banks, but... Spoiling you the fun wouldn't be nice, now would it?\n\n**Steam**: I guess not!\n\n**Zoo**: Oh and... When you arrive at Dream World, make sure to find a bot named Ree.\n\n**Steam**: Who is her? A more advanced bot than the others?\n\n**Zoo**: She's a hooker, Steam.\n\n**Steam**: Oh.\n\n**Zoo _(smiling)_**: You can go now, Steam.\n\n**Steam**: Alright, boss. See you later.\n\n**Zoo _(looking out the window)_**: Goodbye.\n\n_(Steam leaves Zoo's office, Zoo takes a sip of his coffee and sits down on the desk.)_\n\n---\n\n#THE END OF PROLOGUE",
