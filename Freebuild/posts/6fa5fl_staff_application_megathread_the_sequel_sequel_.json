I also resigned because of general stress from school and internet issues, it was all too much for me at that moment.\n\n**Notable skills:** Worldedit, building and activity (not really a skill but still something.)\n\n**What are your plans for when you become staff?:** Be more active on the MC server and try to do my job with the best of my abilities.\n\n**In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:** I can watch over the server at times when not a lot of staff is online, I'll also participate in discussions in staff and try to look at said situation from multiple sides. Stopping \"drama\" is also something I'll try to do.\n\n**What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:** Ban and kick commands, I used to know PEX but the ranks in the system have been changed so I'll have to learn those again, however, I do know the commands themselves (although them being the basic ones.)\n\n**Why should you be staff?:** I used to be Helper but resigned due to the reasons I stated above, however, school is almost ending and my internet is way better now. That's why I'll give Helper another shot, become more active on the Minecraft server and then aim for Moderator. Or just stay Helper if it becomes too much. I also have been with the server for a long time, and want to do something for it.",

If yes, elaborate how:&lt;/strong&gt; Discord (Leaf#3133), Reddit, Steam (smashsonic123) and email (probably not needed, but if so, I will state my email in DMs with trusted users.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future activity:&lt;/strong&gt; While I&amp;#39;m not that active on the MC server anymore, I&amp;#39;m always online on the Discord server, even with bad internet. As I can always connect to slow internet or go on Data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CEST Times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schoolday: 14:15-24:00&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weekend/Vacation: 11:00-3:00 (Depends on when I wake up.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prior experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I was Helper at one point, but I resigned because I didn&amp;#39;t think I did a good job due to not being on the MC server, now knowing that being on the Discord is enough for Helper. I also resigned because of general stress from school and internet issues, it was all too much for me at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Worldedit, building and activity (not really a skill but still something.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; Be more active on the MC server and try to do my job with the best of my abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; I can watch over the server at times when not a lot of staff is online, I&amp;#39;ll also participate in discussions in staff and try to look at said situation from multiple sides. Stopping &amp;quot;drama&amp;quot; is also something I&amp;#39;ll try to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:&lt;/strong&gt; Ban and kick commands, I used to know PEX but the ranks in the system have been changed so I&amp;#39;ll have to learn those again, however, I do know the commands themselves (although them being the basic ones.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should you be staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; I used to be Helper but resigned due to the reasons I stated above, however, school is almost ending and my internet is way better now. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ll give Helper another shot, become more active on the Minecraft server and then aim for Moderator. Or just stay Helper if it becomes too much. I also have been with the server for a long time, and want to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
