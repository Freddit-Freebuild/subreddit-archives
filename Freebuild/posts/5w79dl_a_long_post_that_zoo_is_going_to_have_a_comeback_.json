Nobody, and I mean **nobody** would hate you for no reason.\n\nIve told you this before. Fucking WOGER has been unbanned and is a normal community member like everyone else and he has done REALLY BAD SHIT. But when he was forgiven (like you were so many god damn times) he improved his behaviour. Started behaving. Started being good. Doesnt even pick on spurr anymore. \n\nSpeaking of which, Spurr has not been salty AT ALL for the past month. Around when faz was banned, after that, no more drama came from spurr. And I mean, **nothing**. He improved.\n\nYou refuse to acknowledge that it's you that has a shitty attitude, you refuse to believe that, you strongly believe everyone hates you for no reason and that it's not your fault, and because of that you will NEVER improve.\n\nRealize, like all of us did to ourselves, that you've done wrong and bad shit.

Fucking WOGER has been unbanned and is a normal community member like everyone else and he has done REALLY BAD SHIT. But when he was forgiven (like you were so many god damn times) he improved his behaviour. Started behaving. Started being good. Doesnt even pick on spurr anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, Spurr has not been salty AT ALL for the past month. Around when faz was banned, after that, no more drama came from spurr. And I mean, &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. He improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You refuse to acknowledge that it&amp;#39;s you that has a shitty attitude, you refuse to believe that, you strongly believe everyone hates you for no reason and that it&amp;#39;s not your fault, and because of that you will NEVER improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realize, like all of us did to ourselves, that you&amp;#39;ve done wrong and bad shit. Improve from it, for god&amp;#39;s sake. Im not an angel either, but everytime I fuck up I learn from my mistakes, at least I god damn try, jesus!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Poke can see modmail, but we never talk about staff things in mod mail.\n\nThis means that doing nothing in the sub you can stay in the staff team (if you're trustworthy) but if you're doing nothing in the discord you can't stay in ownership because you can read staff channels (which you did, mind you).\n\nSo o7 to that argument.\n\n#chapter 2\n\n&gt;the reason i'm banned now was me trying to be nice to someone instead of just ignoring them like everyone else would (/u/jeshire).\n\n_**WRONG**_\n\nYou are banned for repeatedly causing drama (4 events in two days), and keep breaking rules.\n\nAlso, Jeshire is AdamC_YT. He has been a normal user for a LONG while. He joined around your time, he has a room in my hotel, even.\n\nBut somehow, jokejailing him making him lose his position on where he was (he couldnt do /back) is **being nice to a player**. It's not, fam, he was annoyed by that and you made him loose where he was.\n\nSo o7 to that argument as well.\n\n&gt;the ban was extended to a week because i told orb to shut up, because everyone knows nobody on freddit has ever told me to 'shut the fuck up', ha ha, totally not\n\nYou clearly passed limits. Orb was being nice to you and you just completly told him to \"shut the fuck up\" trying to create even more drama.\n\nSo o7 to that argument,\n\n&gt;the ban was extended to a week because i told orb to shut up, \n\nNope, your ban was extended to a week because of the tantrum you've been causing the past days.\n\nSo o7 to that assumption, not even an argument.\n\n#Chapter 3\n\n&gt;i'm saying this for the 3rd time. a lot of staff members seem to hate me.\n\n_**WRONG**_\n\nA lot of the staff members used to simply not like you very much. They didnt hate you. You kept pushing their buttons, as of now, as of this moment, they probably now start to hate you - good job on asking so many fucking times on wether people hate you that you might've pushed them over the edge.\n\nAlso, you outright said you hated me on the discord. No hipocrisy here, keep walking along! Hehe!\n\nDammit, goodbye assumption again. Well it might be true now that you've successefuly annoyed everyone with your shitty attitude.\n\n&gt; only person, ghire, has actually made sense and been helpful to me. soda is also pretty nice, but everyone else it feels like hates my guts, even if they say 'they don't.'\n\nYou said you were glad I was feeling agitated IRL and then said that I've also felt this way towards you but never expressed it (YES cus you can tell my emotions and how I think). That's being the opposite of what you want people to treat you.\n\nWait wasnt it you who kept quoting \"treat onto others what you want others to treat onto you\"? Oh wait...\n\n#chapter 4\n\n&gt;no offense to zen, they're cool, but they're inactive as all hell.\n\nNice, zen had nothing to do with this but go on and drag her down. NOTHING to do with your drama events lately, NOT A SINGLE INACTIVITY ARGUMENT has been used for your bans in the past days, but you're going to use it.\n\nWith this dragging down of zen to the shit with you you've just lowered your chances. She had nothing to do with anything.\n\now seven\n\n&gt;but they're inactive as all hell. zoo says \"we dont have a replacement so we dont have to get rid of her\" but they didn't have 'a replacement' for me\n\nYou've resigned on your free-will. And we did have a replacement for you - sven/me. \n\n&gt;but almost nobody at all seems to care about zens inactivity, not nearly as much as they cared about my inactivity. my inactivity became a meme, of all things!\n\nBecause there was no Zoo when you were inactive. Basically we had no active owners. Now we have me and Sven, and we're active. When you were inactive, there was no one else to do your job besides me as manager.\n\nSo o7 to that argument.\n\n#ending\n\n&gt;once again, i'm sure zoo is gonna come out with a huge-ass comment about why everything i said in this post is wrong and say \"but you didn't exactly say everything that happened! you're a bad person!\" or something else sarcastic to that extent\n\nyou didnt exactly say everything that happened, jafc, you're a bad person, yeah zoo is a bad person boo hoo, something else sarcastic to that extent.\n\n&gt;and yeah, maybe everything in this post isn't true.\n\nWELP. JUST, FUCKING. WELP.\n\n&gt; everything is so strict now, too. i can't do anything without zoo or some other staff member getting mad at me and saying i'm a bad person for doing x y z. i want to be treated fairly.\n\nOh we're going down this logic? So, you basically jokejailed someone and made him lost the /back location - which is a bad thing. You've jokekicked some 4 people and when gotten a deop you brought down Orb and Woger because Orb kicked you because you broke some shit at his lab and because Woger had joke kicked.\n\nYou've also started all kinds of drama in the discord. All in all, JAFC has done nothing wrong, and the fault is on the staff that is too strict.\n\n---\n\nNobody fucking enjoys your saltiness and the drama you've caused. If we have to be strict in order to shut that shit down, we will. One thing is to joke around, another thing is to be a complete annoyance that only causes drama.\n\n",

Poke can see modmail, but we never talk about staff things in mod mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that doing nothing in the sub you can stay in the staff team (if you&amp;#39;re trustworthy) but if you&amp;#39;re doing nothing in the discord you can&amp;#39;t stay in ownership because you can read staff channels (which you did, mind you).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So o7 to that argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;chapter 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the reason i&amp;#39;m banned now was me trying to be nice to someone instead of just ignoring them like everyone else would (&lt;a href=\"/u/jeshire\"&gt;/u/jeshire&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are banned for repeatedly causing drama (4 events in two days), and keep breaking rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, Jeshire is AdamC_YT. He has been a normal user for a LONG while. He joined around your time, he has a room in my hotel, even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow, jokejailing him making him lose his position on where he was (he couldnt do /back) is &lt;strong&gt;being nice to a player&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not, fam, he was annoyed by that and you made him loose where he was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So o7 to that argument as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the ban was extended to a week because i told orb to shut up, because everyone knows nobody on freddit has ever told me to &amp;#39;shut the fuck up&amp;#39;, ha ha, totally not&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You clearly passed limits. Orb was being nice to you and you just completly told him to &amp;quot;shut the fuck up&amp;quot; trying to create even more drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So o7 to that argument,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the ban was extended to a week because i told orb to shut up, &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope, your ban was extended to a week because of the tantrum you&amp;#39;ve been causing the past days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So o7 to that assumption, not even an argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m saying this for the 3rd time. a lot of staff members seem to hate me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the staff members used to simply not like you very much. They didnt hate you. You kept pushing their buttons, as of now, as of this moment, they probably now start to hate you - good job on asking so many fucking times on wether people hate you that you might&amp;#39;ve pushed them over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you outright said you hated me on the discord. No hipocrisy here, keep walking along! Hehe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dammit, goodbye assumption again. Well it might be true now that you&amp;#39;ve successefuly annoyed everyone with your shitty attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;only person, ghire, has actually made sense and been helpful to me. soda is also pretty nice, but everyone else it feels like hates my guts, even if they say &amp;#39;they don&amp;#39;t.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You said you were glad I was feeling agitated IRL and then said that I&amp;#39;ve also felt this way towards you but never expressed it (YES cus you can tell my emotions and how I think). That&amp;#39;s being the opposite of what you want people to treat you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait wasnt it you who kept quoting &amp;quot;treat onto others what you want others to treat onto you&amp;quot;? Oh wait...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;chapter 4&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;no offense to zen, they&amp;#39;re cool, but they&amp;#39;re inactive as all hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nice, zen had nothing to do with this but go on and drag her down. NOTHING to do with your drama events lately, NOT A SINGLE INACTIVITY ARGUMENT has been used for your bans in the past days, but you&amp;#39;re going to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this dragging down of zen to the shit with you you&amp;#39;ve just lowered your chances. She had nothing to do with anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ow seven&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but they&amp;#39;re inactive as all hell. zoo says &amp;quot;we dont have a replacement so we dont have to get rid of her&amp;quot; but they didn&amp;#39;t have &amp;#39;a replacement&amp;#39; for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve resigned on your free-will.
