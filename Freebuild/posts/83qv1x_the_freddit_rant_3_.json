The removal of this post will only solidify that.\n\nSo here I am, Ballonz, owner++founder+pissyellow of Freddit Freebuild.\n\nLet's create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.\n\n#Contention 1: Staff\n\nBeing a staff member had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit's staff was just fluff. Manager or whatever. Basically all of the staff roles were fucking useless until Admin where you would have finite permissions.\n\nMoving on from the fundamental flaws, the staff team itself has always been good.\n\nI've seen 2 good staff members. Monsterdobbs and Nintendo.\n\nOrb - Text book example on why 100+ year old men shouldn't be allowed to run servers.\n\nSven - A fucking lunatic with delays bigger than thought to be possible.\n\nZelda - m\n\nLeedle - What the fuck is this homo shit?\n\nPsy - One of the worst staff members I think I've seen anywhere. Imagine a big intimidating balloon, except it pops if you look at it weirdly.\n\nKeep in mind, these are or have been some of the top people in charge of the server. If I was talking about all staff, people like Torn would be filling up this post. Alas, I don't have the time for that.\n\n#Contention 2: Torn and Zoo\n\nTornado - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.\n\nZoo - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for tbc.\n\nFor some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Zoo) has resigned over some stupid grudges.\n\nAm i here to defend Tornado and Zoo? No they can eat tide pods. Am I here for the staff then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely intelligent. You created \"wars\", specifically comprised of downtime for regular players and fucking meaningless tension. All because you're fucking little kids who can't handle a situation like this with player convenience in mind.\n\n#Contention 3: Hip Memes\n\nShitposts were, are, and will always be great. Is this bad? Nope. The TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER love to join in on them. The leaders cleanse the chat with their amazing memes. \n\nYou know who likes Homo erectus resigning from Obamacare? Everyone.\n\nThe hospital RPs, while they may be intentionally shittily played, were pushed as the face of Freddit's comedy. Were they funny? No. Not because they were edgy, but because they were so over the top. Make a pastiche of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Spurr's hospital RPs.\n\n#Contention 4: World countries\n\nthey're not real fuck off. i have over 200 screenshots of the inside of every nation's congress buildings.\n\n#Final Contention: \"Guys let's fix things\"\n\nThe staff team is great. Everyday bro.\n\nAny time the staff tries to revise or reform things, they are resolved.\n\ni need help cleaning up my pet's literal dogshit.\n\nThis was the final proof to me that the staff team, Psy in particular, are far more incompetent than I thought a human being could be. They're so wallowed in their own ego-boners, that I'll actually be amazed if they let this post stay up.\n\nTo anyone who's read this, thank you.\n\nFreddit has gone from fucking actual trash to okay. I'll be returning, and I urge you out there to stay.\n\nJouji.\n\n~Psy\n\nPs: Freddit vs. the Multiverse on 8 June 2018, trailer next Monday\n",
