And then, cross those bunny ears so that they form an X in the air. Are you following it?\n\n~~--~~ Mhm.\n\n~~--~~ Loop the bottom bunny ear over and through the top bunny ear. And finally, pull the bunny ears out to the side away from the shoe. Like... so.\n\n~~--~~ You're really smart, dad!\n\n~~--~~ I won't be around forever, little man. I can show you the road, but you have to be the one to walk it.\n\n~~--~~ What road? Where does it go?\n\n~~--~~ Hahahahahah. Towards a brighter future, of course! And you will make that future come true some day, son. \n\n~~--~~ I want to be superman!\n\n~~--~~ I think you're a little too short for that, don't you think, Zoo?\n\n~~--~~ But superman could've been short! He shoots lasers out of his eyes!\n\n~~--~~ I don't think you're quite there yet, son.\n\n~~--~~ Well I want to fight bad guys and kick their asses!\n\n~~--~~ *Sigh* ~~--~~ *Zoo's dad sits down on the couch, and lights up a cigarette* ~~--~~ It's time you start thinking who you really want to become, Zoo.\n\n~~--~~ But I already told you! I want to be superman.\n\n~~--~~ Enough of this. You are a man, son. It's time for you to be a Man. \n\n[Setting](https://i.imgur.com/grc4aiN.png)\n\nThe year is 2023, and another day passed by. It's 8:30 in the morning, and Zoo is in his bedroom, wearing his blue robe, looking out of his window in the T.B.C. Mansion.\n\nHe's sitting in a chair right next to his bed, with a pen on his right hand and a mug on the other. Someone knocks at his bedroom door.\n\n~~--~~ Mr. Zoo, it's 8:30 in the morning.\n\n~~--~~ Ah, yes, yes! The southern T.B.C. Supercruiser should be lifting off right about now!\n\n~~--~~ I was referring to the fact that your morning briefing started half an hour ago, sir.\n\nA flash of light is seen in the distance through the window, and both Zoo and his assistant immediatly turn to look at it. The light is followed by smoke, and soon enough the sun starts getting blocked by the rising spacecraft.\n\n~~--~~ Yeah, Susanne, but none of my morning briefings have _that_, now do they? Hahahah.\n\n~~--~~ I suppose not, sir. ~~--~~ *The assistant remains amazed* ~~--~~  But Dr. Orb called, he has a new military prototype in the works, says it could help the situation down in Faztown. \n\n~~--~~ Let me guess, hoopla?\n\n~~--~~ Mhm.\n\n~~--~~ *Sigh*, more wasted potential. Do you see the Supercruiser flying over those clouds right now? Its engines are powered by hoopla.\n\n~~--~~ Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you had to watch a lot of Freddit Files to obtain such a high IQ to even think of that idea.\n\n~~--~~ No, no, not that! But look at that. Just a few kilograms of hoopla gems, and _bam_. 6.5 miles per second.\n\n~~--~~ You mean 5.6 miles?\n\n*Zoo Man smirks*\n\n~~--~~ Are you saying I'm wrong, miss Susanne?\n\n~~--~~ Well, if you said 5.6 miles, no, otherwise, yes. Very wrong.\n\n~~--~~ Hmm. I'll tell you what, if I'm right, I take you out to dinner, if you're right, you get the day off. Deal?\n\n~~--~~ I have a better idea - how about if I'm right, you get dressed and attend the morning briefing?\n\n~~--~~ Hahahahah. ~~--~~ *Zoo Man laughed* ~~--~~ Deal.\n\n[Setting](https://i.imgur.com/4ltCO2F.png)\n\nZoo took a sip of his coffee, got up from his chair, placed the mug on his bedside table, and walked over to the other side of the bed, while looking smugly at Susanne.\n\nOn top of his other bedside table stood a black cillindre - a T.B.C. A.I. appliance designed to help its owner and follow his voice commands.\n\n~~--~~ Freddu, what maximum velocity does the latest T.B.C. Supercruiser model get on ascension?\n\n~~--~~ 5.6 miles per second.\n\nZoo Man looked at his assistant with a surprised look.\n\n~~--~~ Well I'll be damned! Looks like dinner is postponed, miss Susanne.\n\n~~--~~ Don't take it personal, Zoo. There's a good reason why I'm your assistant.\n\n~~--~~ Because I pay you?\n\n~~--~~ Truth is, sometimes it feels like I'm your babysitter.\n\n~~--~~ I mean, it ain't so bad, is it?\n\n~~--~~ I work for a man whose net worth is 98.5 trillion dollars.\n\n*Susanne looks at Zoo, her expression bearing a question that Zoo catches on to.*\n\n~~--~~ I know my net worth, don't look at me like that.\n\n~~--~~ Oh really? Do you even know your own age, Zoo?\n\n~~--~~ Aha! 23 years old. I knew that one! What about you, miss Susanne?\n\n~~--~~ You're stalling.\n\n*Zoo Man laughs*\n\n~~--~~ You know what, it _does_ sometimes feel like you're my babysitter.\n\n~~--~~ Yeah, yeah, now get dressed, Zoo, you lost the bet. The Council is waiting. ~~--~~ *Susanne smirked, then turned around and left the bedroom.*\n\n[Setting](https://i.imgur.com/JltMnSa.png)\n\n*At the morning briefing, in the T.B.C. Tower. Zoo is looking out the window, reflecting on some of the information he's just gotten. He turns around, and finally speaks.*\n\n~~--~~ An interdimensional telephone, Director?\n\n~~--~~ Yes, sir. Materialized out of thin air in one of our T.B.C. establishments. One of those hotels in downtown NFC.\n\n~~--~~ Has anyone made a call yet?\n\n~~--~~ We're not sure. The telephone is under quarantine and being analyzed by our top investigators, but so far nobody has called in yet.\n\n~~--~~ Alright, make sure to tell me if anything happens with the telephone.\n\n~~--~~ As you wish, Mr. Zoo.\n\n*Zoo Man turns around to face Dr. Orb*\n\n~~--~~ Do you have any idea what could've happened over there, doctor?\n\n~~--~~ Vell no, but if I had to make a guess, I'd say it might have to do with the Multiverse.\n\n*Director Leedle bears a shocked expression, and immediately interrupts the doctor.*\n\n~~--~~ Oh, please, the Multiverse theory is nothing but a fairy tale! Mr. Zoo, may I ask, what is Doctor Orb doing in a morning briefing?\n\n[Setting](https://i.imgur.com/pdggOiH.png)\n\n*Zoo looks right into Leedle's eyes, displeased with the apparent lack of respect.*\n\n~~--~~ He's our business partner, Director Leedle.\n\n~~--~~ Business partner?\n\n~~--~~ That's right.\n\n~~--~~ Sir, if I am to be completely honest, I wouldn't call him that.\n\n*Starting to show disappointment at Leedle's behavior, Zoo Man starts slowly walking towards him.*\n\n~~--~~ I wouldn't ask for your opinion, either, but seeing how you've already expressed it, do you want to elaborate?\n\n~~--~~ I... Uh... Simply don't consider him a peer, that's all, Mr. Zoo. We own his corporation. We bought him and his company, he makes weapons for us. Besides, isn't--\n\n*The Director stops once he notices the look on Zoo's face.*\n\n~~--~~ Are you finished?\n\n~~--~~ Sir, I didn't mean any disresp--\n\n~~--~~ Have you forgotten who you work for, Director?\n\n~~--~~ What?\n\n~~--~~ Do I really need to repeat myself?\n\n~~--~~ I work for you, sir. For The Broccoli Company.\n\n~~--~~ That's right, Director. You work for me, and so does Dr. Orb. You will be treated as equals. However, seeing how Dr. Orb has been much more successful in his... *affairs*, than you have been with your tasks, I'd say you are worth to me even less.\n\n~~--~~ Sir...\n\n~~--~~ Perhaps... I shouldn't be treating you as peers, after all. Perhaps trusting you to this position was a bad investment. What do you think, Leedle?\n\n~~--~~ Mr. Zoo, I don't kn--\n\n~~--~~ SIR! ~~--~~ *A T.B.C. Engineer bursts into the room.* ~~--~~ WE HAVE A REACTOR BREACH!\n\n*Zoo Man turns around and stares intensely at the engineer's eyes.*\n\n~~--~~ The Tower reactors? Which one?\n\n~~--~~ Hoopla Reactor Zeta. The whole sector is on lockdown. We need to evacuate the Tower.\n\n~~--~~ One of the Hoopla series? Well I'll be damned! ~~--~~ *Zoo turns to Leedle* ~~--~~ Director?\n\n~~--~~ Sir, I have no idea how this could've happ-\n\n~~--~~ You were in charge of the creation and maintenance of the reactors, Director Leedle. Now I need to evacuate my company's HQ due to your own lack of competence.\n\n~~--~~ I-I can assure you, sir, the reactors used to power T.B.C. Tower are the top of the line.\n\n~~--~~ Top of the line? These barely functional no good reactors are your best, Director?\n\n~~--~~ Sir, I...\n\n~~--~~ Do you know of the importance of the six reactors, Director?\n\n~~--~~ Yes, sir.\n\n~~--~~ Don't make me mention how valuable they are to our recent project, Director Leedle. I strongly suggest you fix them, and you fix them fast.\n\n~~--~~ I'm on it, sir.\n\n~~--~~ Oh, one more thing.\n\n*Leedle stops walking, and looks back*\n\n~~--~~ Don't disappoint me ever again, Director.\n\n~~--~~ O-Of course not, sir. I'll get the problem sorted out as soon as possible.\n\n*Leedle walks out of the meeting room, avoiding eye contact while looking down, and trying to hold his paperwork in his trembling hands.*",

Do you even know your own age, Zoo?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Aha! 23 years old. I knew that one! What about you, miss Susanne?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; You&amp;#39;re stalling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoo Man laughs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; You know what, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; sometimes feel like you&amp;#39;re my babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Yeah, yeah, now get dressed, Zoo, you lost the bet. The Council is waiting. &lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;Susanne smirked, then turned around and left the bedroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JltMnSa.png\"&gt;Setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the morning briefing, in the T.B.C. Tower. Zoo is looking out the window, reflecting on some of the information he&amp;#39;s just gotten. He turns around, and finally speaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; An interdimensional telephone, Director?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Yes, sir. Materialized out of thin air in one of our T.B.C. establishments. One of those hotels in downtown NFC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Has anyone made a call yet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; We&amp;#39;re not sure. The telephone is under quarantine and being analyzed by our top investigators, but so far nobody has called in yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Alright, make sure to tell me if anything happens with the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; As you wish, Mr. Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoo Man turns around to face Dr. Orb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Do you have any idea what could&amp;#39;ve happened over there, doctor?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Vell no, but if I had to make a guess, I&amp;#39;d say it might have to do with the Multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director Leedle bears a shocked expression, and immediately interrupts the doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Oh, please, the Multiverse theory is nothing but a fairy tale! Mr. Zoo, may I ask, what is Doctor Orb doing in a morning briefing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pdggOiH.png\"&gt;Setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoo looks right into Leedle&amp;#39;s eyes, displeased with the apparent lack of respect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; He&amp;#39;s our business partner, Director Leedle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Business partner?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; That&amp;#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Sir, if I am to be completely honest, I wouldn&amp;#39;t call him that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting to show disappointment at Leedle&amp;#39;s behavior, Zoo Man starts slowly walking towards him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; I wouldn&amp;#39;t ask for your opinion, either, but seeing how you&amp;#39;ve already expressed it, do you want to elaborate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; I... Uh... Simply don&amp;#39;t consider him a peer, that&amp;#39;s all, Mr. Zoo. We own his corporation. We bought him and his company, he makes weapons for us. Besides, isn&amp;#39;t--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Director stops once he notices the look on Zoo&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Are you finished?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Sir, I didn&amp;#39;t mean any disresp--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Have you forgotten who you work for, Director?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; What?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Do I really need to repeat myself?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; I work for you, sir. For The Broccoli Company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; That&amp;#39;s right, Director. You work for me, and so does Dr. Orb. You will be treated as equals. However, seeing how Dr. Orb has been much more successful in his... &lt;em&gt;affairs&lt;/em&gt;, than you have been with your tasks, I&amp;#39;d say you are worth to me even less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Sir...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Perhaps... I shouldn&amp;#39;t be treating you as peers, after all. Perhaps trusting you to this position was a bad investment. What do you think, Leedle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Mr. Zoo, I don&amp;#39;t kn--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; SIR! &lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;A T.B.C. Engineer bursts into the room.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; WE HAVE A REACTOR BREACH!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoo Man turns around and stares intensely at the engineer&amp;#39;s eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; The Tower reactors? Which one?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Hoopla Reactor Zeta. The whole sector is on lockdown. We need to evacuate the Tower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; One of the Hoopla series? Well I&amp;#39;ll be damned! &lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;Zoo turns to Leedle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Director?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Sir, I have no idea how this could&amp;#39;ve happ-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; You were in charge of the creation and maintenance of the reactors, Director Leedle. Now I need to evacuate my company&amp;#39;s HQ due to your own lack of competence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; I-I can assure you, sir, the reactors used to power T.B.C. Tower are the top of the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Top of the line? These barely functional no good reactors are your best, Director?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Sir, I...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Do you know of the importance of the six reactors, Director?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Yes, sir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Don&amp;#39;t make me mention how valuable they are to our recent project, Director Leedle. I strongly suggest you fix them, and you fix them fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; I&amp;#39;m on it, sir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Oh, one more thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leedle stops walking, and looks back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; Don&amp;#39;t disappoint me ever again, Director.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;--&lt;/del&gt; O-Of course not, sir. I&amp;#39;ll get the problem sorted out as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leedle walks out of the meeting room, avoiding eye contact while looking down, and trying to hold his paperwork in his trembling hands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
