But it's just the way I've felt. Who knows maybe I'm just different, maybe I've lost patience, hell if I know but the point is, that I just don't feel, at home here anymore? Freddit has ceased feeling like a place I can spend my time at in a positive manner. I almost never say more then a few words in conversations and even then it's only to a select group of people. \n\n\nI feel like I'm rambling here but I have thought this over and decided that this is for the best. The people who I actually care to stay in contact with are in other servers with me, or know to DM me. And the rest are, well, either people I don't particularly know, or have never felt like talking to for one reason or another. I'm not vanishing from Discord or, the Internet entirely.
