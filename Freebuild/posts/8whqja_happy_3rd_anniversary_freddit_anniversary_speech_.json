What started as something I made out of boredom that I thought would die out in two weeks became a funny, creative and sporadic community. Will we ever really grasp one day why Freddit is the way it is? Probably not entirely.

I personally lost interest in Freddit well over a year ago. I didn't like the way the server went and the way it's going, but I stuck around because you all are my friends. The people I rely on to make me laugh like an idiot and bring out my weird hilarious self when I've gone through trials. When my brother died, I relied on the community to keep me cheered up. When I was in the depressing environment of activism in a place where a shooting happened, I would be able to feel comfortable sharing how I felt and my stories with you guys while still being able to have those laughs through the midst of sadness.\n\nI've realized just recently that at the end of the day, it's not about if the server has all the up-to-date plugins, if there are thirty players on or not, if the staff team is not what I think is ideal- it's really the people that already have been here. What keeps this community thriving is the care we have for each other, and that's the real reason why Freddit has stayed around so long. The fact that this is a tight-knit community that doesn't have hundreds of players as I once dreamed is why it has the charm to keep you here. The fact that we\u2019re small and all know each other. We\u2019ve faced serious issues amongst ourselves but have kept our heads high and moved on.\n\nSo remember why we\u2019re still here, hold it true, and stay alive, Freddit.\n\n-\tChris Freebuild, Founder",

                        "body": "Phil Swift is the spokesman for the Flex Seal family of products. He has an energetic personality and people generally agree that he's very likable.\n\nPhil was born in the heart of a dying star in the Andromeda galaxy during the creation of the Milky Way. The dense elements he was born in gave his titanium-hard muscles. After orbiting the universe for some years, he came crashing down toward Earth on August 6, 1944, his body completely leveled Hiroshima, Japan just moments before the nuclear bomb was dropped. He fought in Vietnam, earning the nickname \"Indestructable Phil\" for his 100,000 plus confirmed kills with little more than his bare hands. He is best known for his catchphrase, \"That's a lotta damage\" after accidentally burning down a Vietnam village in a fit of rage. While in Vietnam, he created a super-strong adhesive with a mixture of his own celestial blood and tree sap. His invention was widely used to treat severed arteries. He then moved on to singlehandedly reattach severed limbs of soldiers in Iraq, (though he often mixed up legs and arms) and even offered therapy to those who had experienced the loss of loved ones during the war. If only Phil could tape my life back together too. Recently, he has begun marketing his invention. He is well known for his ads, in which his PTSD causes him to slaughter buckets and boats by channeling the power of hell. This is why many consider him to be the supreme leader of the universe, with power beyond any humans imagination. Flex Seal and Related Works Phil is most famously known for his advertisements of the products known as but not limited to: Flex Seal, Flex Tape, Flex Shot, etc.\n\nAll these products, also known as the Flex Seal Family of Products, were gifts from the heavens, so we would be able to coat, seal and stop leaks fast. Foolish mortals like us are not capable of making any product close to the power of Flex Seal, nor any other Flex Seal product. Not even the great Nacho Chez Gaming can summon something as great as this.\n\nFlex Seal is a revolutionary, life-saving product, capable of coating, sealing and stopping leaks fast. Some say it protected America from Logan Paul's suicide video. Flex Seal is a liquid rubber in a can, capable of sleeping into cracks and holes, and it dries to a water-tight, flexible, rubberized coating. One simple shot of Flex Seal will instantly patch up any hole, immediately stopping leaks fast (multiple coats may need to be used). Two shots can knock out any bullies you want that hate on your minecraft lets play videos. Its like a handyman in a can, capable of fixing destroyed buckets, and preventing leaks. Flex Tape is a super strong waterproof tape that can instantly patch, bond, seal and repair. Flex Tape is no ordinary tape. It's triple thiccc adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Flex Tape's powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas without draining them. Flex Tape is S U P E R S T R O N G, and once it's on, it holds on tight. Tighter than my girlfriend in LA's ass. Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holds. Flex Tape is such an incredibly useful product, that Phil sawed a boat in half and repaired it with only Flex Tape. Nothing short of a revolutionary product sent by the gods of Athens.\n\nFlex Spray is a lot like the previously mentioned Flex Seal. What differentiates this product from Flex Seal is the Spray is like normal Spray paint, and can easily spread out to take up more space. You can create submarines out of cars ayylmao.\n\nFlex Seal Color is a liquid rubber in a can, capable of seeping into cracks and holes, and it dries to a water-tight, flexible, rubberized coating, a lot like the aforementioned Flex Seal. The difference between this and the original Flex Seal is that this comes in 9 different colors, which can be used to spray on any surface. The color in Flex Seal Color is shown to be even more effective than spray paint when it comes to spraying on walls and other surfaces. Flex Seal Color's least popular color is black and most popular is white. Flex Shot is a lot like Flex Seal, but Flex Shot will fill larger holes and can be used as a caulking, where as Flex Seal is sprayed on and can cover a larger surface to make it completely waterproof. You may need several coats of Flex Seal to make the surface completely waterproof, but Flex Shot is a one time rubber bead that can be built up. This should make Flex Shot the leader of the Flex Seal family of products, but falls behind to Flex Seal, due to branding, and being the original. This makes Flex Shot one of the most underrated Flex Seal products.\n\nWith revolutionary products like these, only a true god has what it takes to advertise said products to the masses, and that role was given to the almighty Phil Swift, supreme leader, universe master, and advertisement genius",

The game features a crudely animated character named Baldi who attempts to stop the player from escaping the school by asking them to solve math problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory                       \nOn March 31st, 2018, the independent game developer Micah McGonigal released Baldi's Basics for free on Itch.io.[1] \nIn the game's description, McGonigal described the game:\n\n\n\n\n\"Inspired by creepy/bad edutainment games from the 90s (Sonic's Schoolhouse, I.M. Meen, 3D Dinosaur Adventure: Save the Dinosaurs), this game starts out seemingly innocent enough, but it quickly becomes clear that this isn't edutainment. Collect all 7 of the notebooks and escape the school, all while avoiding Baldi. Baldi has many friends in the school that will slow down your progress and put you at risk of being caught, so learn how each character works and how you can avoid their attention. Find and use items to your advantage. Oh, and finally, try not to get the quiz answers wrong\u2026 Each wrong answer makes Baldi angrier\u2026\nThat day, he tweeted,[2] \"It's finally finished\u2026 Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning is now available to download! https://mystman12.itch.io/baldis-basics Be warned, it's really bad. #MetaGameJam #gamedev.\" The post (shown below) received more than 50 retweets and 310 likes in two months.\n\n\n\nThe game was created for the Meta Game Jam, a video game competition in which users attempt to create the most self-aware game possible. Baldi's came in 2nd place with 39 ratings and a score of .548.[5] Following the release, the game received a 4.8 rating on Itch.io.\n\nOn April 12th, the video game website Kotaku [6] gave Baldi a positive review. They wrote, \"The titular Baldi will stalk you throughout the school, creepily smacking a ruler against his hand. If he finds you, you get a jumpscare and a game over. Baldi\u2019s Basics isn\u2019t that deep, but I loved both its commitment to the joke of making fun of bad edutainment games and how well it pivots from humor to horror. It\u2019s free on itch.io, and probably would be fun to prank your friends with.\"\n\nOn May 28th, 2018, YouTuber Markiplier published a \"Let's Play\" video of the game.
