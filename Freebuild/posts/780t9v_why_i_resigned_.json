It is a simple process that could easily be automated. In fact, the whole process is practically ignored and nonexistent.

The context was that I wanted to actually unify Arab, Spurr, and Woger into actually agreeing over something instead of bickering over virtual LEGO government systems that rule over no one. I had falsely claimed that I was going to remove Jarab, Wogtown, and Faztown and build a new theme park over it. The moment I joined, Spurr joined in and banned me. This resulted in his demotion but has been the first incident where I would question my willingness to continue being part of staff.\n\n8) I simply want to give others a chance at staff. I have taken up a spot as admin for a long while now, and I want to free up a space for future members of staff who may do a better job than I ever could. Of course, new members of staff may as well be former members of staff, but I am hopeful that, in due course of time, new players will take on the ranks of staff and do a better job than any member of staff, former or current, could ever do.\n\n9) I want to work on other things and being staff has interfered with their progress.
