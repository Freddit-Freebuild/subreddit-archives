As many are building defenses for the biggest attack(s), some of the Resistance members are tasked to spy and enter into the Mothership, to find their true plan.

FIGHT FOR FREDDIT**\n\nFreddit is at it's final moments. The final fleet of Spurrians have arrived. The final fight is ready. The Resistance prepares to fight, and so do the Spurrians. The name says it all. Who will win? It will be revealed during the RP...\n\nsometime after part 2\n\n\n----\n\nAnd here's a recap of part 1\n\n**INVASION 2: PART 1. IT COMES**\n\nThe group of Fredditors have already gotten into enough trouble with the RDA. Now, the Spurrians have returned, and they want revenge. After a long gunfight with the Dryzians, everyone retreats indoors. The mothership parks in its place, and the UFOs destroy some of the city. They are suddenly teleported into another dimension and/or timeline. They take this power to travel across different timelines, trying to find the safest one. However, they find themselves trapped in a universe where the Spurrians won. They find an old Orb who has been the only survivor. Unfortunately, he kills the current Orb in panic. They use an emergency teleport to find themselves back in RPcity, where they finally discover the real destruction.\n\nThe older Orb finally discovers that the Spurrians in our timeline are going to take OrbCorps two deadliest powers- the portal generator and the Eradicator",
