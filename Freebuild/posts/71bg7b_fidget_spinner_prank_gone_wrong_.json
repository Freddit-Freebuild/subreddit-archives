The lost of my work, the lost of people I used to consider friends. It was quite dramatic for me.  \nRight now, you may also have heard about the actions I had during BFF. You should just know a few things: I was trying to be as pacifist as possible. Sometimes I was angered by some actions from Freddit that were leaked there.

It doesn't mean I keep being an idiot and remembering the good times I had on Freddit, which if you're wondering, lead me to regret my actions, many times. As hard as you can convince yourself to believe I didn't, it doesn't change the fact that I certainly did.
