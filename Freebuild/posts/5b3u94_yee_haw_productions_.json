It's for people that live that Yee Haw kind of lifestyle! Hehe. My chew is so good, you'll be forced to say \"Yee Haw\" every time it touches your mouth. YEE HAW! It's completely uncontrollable. YEE HAW YEE HAW! Once you get it in, you're ready to do some Yee Haw kind of shit. For example: Watching NASCAR, Yee Haw. Shootin' your gun, Yee Haw. Cleanin your cowboy boots, Yee Haw. And chuggin a bunch of cheap beer! And a double yee haw! My Yee Haw Chew comes in two distinct flavors: Original Yee Haw, and Yee Haw Rollin' Coal\u2122. Made with real bits of coal! If you chew it long enough, you'll make diamonds! Haha, just kiddin'. Diamonds are formed at high temperatures and pressure over 87 miles in the Earth's mantle. And take anywhere 1 to 7 billion years to form! Ya dummy. My chew is made of three natural ingredients; Chew, gasoline, and molasses! Giving you, the moistest chew you've ever had! And also, the thickest, richest spit you've ever had. Yee Haw Chew, for the Yee Haw, in you.\n\nYee Haw Chew contains Yee Haw chemicals not suitable for coon dogs or children under the age of Yee Haw.\n\n----\n\nYEE HAW!\n\nYou yee, and then you haw. It's easy. West Virginia Dad here, and thanks to the unbelievable success of my Yee Haw Chew, I'm here to bring you- THREE NEW FLAVORS! Heh. NUMBER ONE: Wintermean. It's like wintergreen but meaner. Listerine, Nicotine, and CHEW all bottled up into one. It's gonna feel like you just brushed your teeth! But since it's chew, it has the exact opposite effect. So, still brush your teeth regularly okay? NUMBER TWO: Buckshot. I cut open an entire box of shotgun shells and poured the contents into my chew- giving it a sweet and spicy kind of flavor! Do not chew this near an open flame, there is real gunpowder in here. It will blow your face off. YEE HAW! NUMBER THREE: Mountain Chew. Dale came into me in my dream and said \"Caleb, I want you to soak your chew in Mountain Dew\" I looked at him and said, \"Dale, is that even possible?\" And he looked at me, and said \"Trust me- Put the dew, in the chew.\" I said, \"Dale, I'll trust any words that pass through that beautiful moustache of yours.\" So when I woke up, I made the best chew that's ever been made! You don't even need a spit cup for this! The spit becomes Mountain Dew, ya' just drink it. It's so good. Now, I'm gonna show you how to properly put Yee Haw Chew in your mouth! Yee Haw Chew, for the yee haw, in you... YEE HAW! ;&gt;\n",
