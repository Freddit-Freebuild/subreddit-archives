May not get it, But I am giving it one last shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a way for us to contact you outside Minecraft? If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): Discord: Nickname is 5odasaurus, but my official discord username is Sodasaurus - Skype is captainsoda\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture activity (how active you'll be in the near future): About the same activity I have as of now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior experience: On Freddit, I have been Modmin, Admin, Moderator, Head Moderator (Yes, I was Head Mod for a short time.) I think I was Helper too once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn other servers: Moderator a couple of times, Admin a few times, and Helper once.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable skills: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like helping, I have plans to actually improve that, I build sometimes, I have built a new free build world spawn. A lifesize FNAF 1, and the head of Zen. There is a lot of builds I have done, and most of them have warps.\nI have previously been involved with drama, so I guess I am okay with dealing with drama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am OK at command blocks, and plenty of experience with worldguard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: I am technically staff, But if I get promoted, I plan to do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAct more sophisticated and mature ( which I will start now, promotion or not )\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a brief discussion with staff about what I can do / what I can improve (not as a review, alright?)\n\n\n\n\nSay less 'jokes'\n\n\n\n\n\nI will reinforce the rules better, I will protect the server and hopefully make the players feel safe.\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Depends on what everybody else wants. I'd check spawn every now and then like Zen did, make sure no one griefed, I will make sure to watch chat more often, Hopefully act less immature, and I would ask players every so often if they need help. Give me a job and I will do it. I will try to be more serious and check staff channels every so often. and discuss the  events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a list of ban durations and kicks for rule breakers:\n\n\n\nSpam - Kick, if they do it again, a temp ban for a minute.\n\n\n\nSaying racial slurs - Temp ban 1 minute, if they do it again, 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriefing - Instant perm ban\n\n\n\n\n\nDisrespecting users/staff - 10 day ban or a week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: Freddit tought me a lot of commands, and some I have already knew. /ban, /kick, /mute, /jail, I have known the essential type of commands, /banip, etc etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I feel really bad because I have done a lot of wrong things recently. Apologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will actually start being better starting the day I join into the server. It will take time for me to get used to it.\nEver since I got Mod, It has messed with me and I made a lot of mistakes, I have been feeling a bit bad lately and I promise you I will improve everything.\nI should be staff/promoted because I feel like I can be a nice admin, I thought about resigning, But I am going to give this a try and see where it goes. I wanna see what it is like to become an Admin, every moment from Admin from my cringe days are just a blur for me. I am sorry for those times, and hopefully I can be much better than those times.\n\n\n\n\n\n###Important: PM me on discord and tell me what to do as an Admin - I want to take notes and make sure I do the listed things.

May not get it, But I am giving it one last shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have a way for us to contact you outside Minecraft? If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): Discord: Nickname is 5odasaurus, but my official discord username is Sodasaurus - Skype is captainsoda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Future activity (how active you&amp;#39;ll be in the near future): About the same activity I have as of now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior experience: On Freddit, I have been Modmin, Admin, Moderator, Head Moderator (Yes, I was Head Mod for a short time.) I think I was Helper too once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On other servers: Moderator a couple of times, Admin a few times, and Helper once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notable skills: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like helping, I have plans to actually improve that, I build sometimes, I have built a new free build world spawn. A lifesize FNAF 1, and the head of Zen. There is a lot of builds I have done, and most of them have warps.\nI have previously been involved with drama, so I guess I am okay with dealing with drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am OK at command blocks, and plenty of experience with worldguard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?: I am technically staff, But if I get promoted, I plan to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Act more sophisticated and mature ( which I will start now, promotion or not )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a brief discussion with staff about what I can do / what I can improve (not as a review, alright?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say less &amp;#39;jokes&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will reinforce the rules better, I will protect the server and hopefully make the players feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Depends on what everybody else wants. I&amp;#39;d check spawn every now and then like Zen did, make sure no one griefed, I will make sure to watch chat more often, Hopefully act less immature, and I would ask players every so often if they need help. Give me a job and I will do it. I will try to be more serious and check staff channels every so often. and discuss the  events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a list of ban durations and kicks for rule breakers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spam - Kick, if they do it again, a temp ban for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying racial slurs - Temp ban 1 minute, if they do it again, 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Griefing - Instant perm ban&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disrespecting users/staff - 10 day ban or a week&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: Freddit tought me a lot of commands, and some I have already knew. /ban, /kick, /mute, /jail, I have known the essential type of commands, /banip, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I feel really bad because I have done a lot of wrong things recently. Apologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will actually start being better starting the day I join into the server. It will take time for me to get used to it.\nEver since I got Mod, It has messed with me and I made a lot of mistakes, I have been feeling a bit bad lately and I promise you I will improve everything.\nI should be staff/promoted because I feel like I can be a nice admin, I thought about resigning, But I am going to give this a try and see where it goes. I wanna see what it is like to become an Admin, every moment from Admin from my cringe days are just a blur for me. I am sorry for those times, and hopefully I can be much better than those times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Important: PM me on discord and tell me what to do as an Admin - I want to take notes and make sure I do the listed things. Thank you very much.&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On weekdays it's usually at night from around 7:30/8:00 to around 9:30/10:00, but certain factors may change this. On weekends and other free nights I'll be on from around 8:00 to somewhere around midnight/1/2 in the morning (very rarely 3 in the morning, but usually not because I like to get up at a decent hour and last time I stayed up until 3, I slept until noon). I might occasionally be on in the afternoon and even morning, and on school delays I'll probably be on from around 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning as well as the time on a weeknight (or free night if Friday).\n\n**Prior Experience**: I don't want to talk about it but I was a moderator/semi-admin on a server when I was 12, and of course I did bad shit and cried when I got banned/demoted. I swear I'm not like that anymore. (also note that for unrelated reasons the server shut down a looong time ago)\n\n**Notable Skills**: When it comes to people in drama, I try to be fair and show tough love to friends if needed. Also I'm a decent builder.\n\n**Plans**: Not really anything specific. I'll help out with stuff if you'd like me to (and if I have time).\n\n**Ways I Can Help**: I could build things and handle petty arguments.\n\n**Commands**: None, to be honest.\n\n**Why I Should Be Staff**: I mean I won't be upset if I'm not staff, I just figured I should give this a shot.",

(This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):** I've honestly wanted so long to have a chance to help the server again. It's why I've apply tied again and again. I'm feeling confident that maybe I can start caring for this community I love again soon. I just would like a taste of being one of the most rational thinking staff members. Dammit, forget being admin, I'd settle for helper.",

Still applyable, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISRESPECT&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;d say a 3 hour ban after 2 warnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be very helpful in lots of things I&amp;#39;ve mentioned above. I can be active, preventing griefs, and overall a responsible staff member.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty much all of them, really. /kick, /ban, /mute, you name it.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve honestly wanted so long to have a chance to help the server again. It&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve apply tied again and again. I&amp;#39;m feeling confident that maybe I can start caring for this community I love again soon. I just would like a taste of being one of the most rational thinking staff members. Dammit, forget being admin, I&amp;#39;d settle for helper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If yes, elaborate how: I'm in the discord server and I have skype (littlegreyfazbear). However, i'm not active on skype.  \n\nFuture activity: As much as i can get on, which is 6 - 8 am and 3:30 - 9 pm (all day on weekends) GMT roughly.\nPior experience: Mod on the old Freddit server, One of the winners of the mistake that was the mod election (Does that help or hurt me?).  \n\nNotable skills: GMT timezone to catch rule breakers that come on at night.  I have experience in moderating on many different servers, I can actively look for griefs as I fly around, I'm very active in the community.  \n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: Support other staff, watching carefully for rule breakers and do my best to help. Banning alts because Chris.  \n\n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: By helping the server and its users, being active in the community, checking for griefs, watch chat, preventing conflict before it happens.  \n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: rollback, most of worldedit, ban, tempban, kick, the helper essentials. I'll most likely learn a lot more as I go on, and will do my best to learn what other things I need to know.  \n\nWhy should you be staff? (This is a more personal question.

If yes, elaborate how: I&amp;#39;m in the discord server and I have skype (littlegreyfazbear). However, i&amp;#39;m not active on skype.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Future activity: As much as i can get on, which is 6 - 8 am and 3:30 - 9 pm (all day on weekends) GMT roughly.\nPior experience: Mod on the old Freddit server, One of the winners of the mistake that was the mod election (Does that help or hurt me?).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notable skills: GMT timezone to catch rule breakers that come on at night.  I have experience in moderating on many different servers, I can actively look for griefs as I fly around, I&amp;#39;m very active in the community.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?: Support other staff, watching carefully for rule breakers and do my best to help. Banning alts because Chris.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: By helping the server and its users, being active in the community, checking for griefs, watch chat, preventing conflict before it happens.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: rollback, most of worldedit, ban, tempban, kick, the helper essentials. I&amp;#39;ll most likely learn a lot more as I go on, and will do my best to learn what other things I need to know.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should you be staff?
