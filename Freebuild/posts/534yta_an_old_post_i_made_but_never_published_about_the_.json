We have grown as a server, but more important, as a community.\n\nBut it hasn't always been like this. In the beggining, there were not much people. Some of them are still in the server.\n\nToday I'll bring you **the story of Freddit**.\n\n----\n\n#Pre-Server\n\nIt's the dawn of a new day in our lives. No one could predict what would happen in **6 months** (!) (2016 edit this is much more it's like 14 months holy shit wtf are we doing), but we were about to enter a whole new world, molded by us.\n\nIt began when Chris decided to create a Minecraft server. You had to ask permission, give your age and some of your abilities. **I was accepted.**\n\n---\n\n#Day 0\n\nThe server started out as a survival server, but very quickly turned into a creative server, in a flat world.\n\nHere's the **[very first spawn](http://imgur.com/iMbaDeP)**. This screenshot was taken on **6th of July of 2015**.\n\n**Me** (Zoocanadanda), **plusonechris** and **SirPluff** are present in some screenshots of the first day. Back then everyone was op, due to the fact that PlusOC couldn't fix permissions.\n\nWhile Chris tried to fix them, we gathered around and took **[the first group screenshot](http://imgur.com/ni9aoP6)** (from left to right: *pluff, Bejaminwolf, AAAAWESOMEme, Zoocanadanda, Drolykz, Canadianboy*)\n\n Keep in mind everyone was opped, and all things were going crazy. At one point in *Day 0*, someone started filling everyone's inventory with slime balls.\n\nI know how to use **[tellraw](http://imgur.com/yeSXiMM)**, so I used it to try and **stop** the guy from filling people's inventory. When Chris read the log, **he noticed my tellraw command**, but he interperted that as if I was the guy who filled.\n\n**I was banned**.\n\n---\n\n#Growth\n\nI convinced Chris that I wasn't the guy who filled everyone's inventory, and he unbanned me. The server was growing stronger every day. **Benjamin and Droylkz were now admins** and lots of people joined the server including **[Pokechef](http://imgur.com/VDMteKe)**, [**Megalex** (in the chat)](http://imgur.com/k5jIr7C)\n\nEven **[Kairinezz joined!](http://imgur.com/ZYUtuUu)** Can you believe it?\n\nThe server was having an overwhelming growth in terms of popularity. Builds were coming up left and right, until...\n\n**The /nuke of 2k15**.\n\nOn the faithful day of 8 of July, Chris decided to \"prank\" everyone by scaring us with /nuke. He was sure it wouldn't grief anything, so he [**did it**](http://imgur.com/Lyfa1ru)\n\nThere was just one problem. For some reason, the default setting of the command /nuke was set so it would enable griefing. In other words, [**shit got real very fast.**](http://imgur.com/zG7MsJe)\n\nThe /nuke destroyed my FNAF 1's pizzeria, Purple Guy's arm, a lot of other buildings and the official FNAF1 building. We made a [**memorial**](http://imgur.com/B2FJbc9). **(NOTE FROM 2016: SMASHSONIC123 IS KOOPAG)**\n\n[**Never forget.**](http://imgur.com/0jQEssB)\n\n---\n\n#Post /nukeclear attack\n\nAfter the /nuke that killed thousands of lives and destroyed hundreds of buildings (not really), the server continued to grow. Me, Benjaminwolf and xtremegamer decided to build [**FNAF 3 building**](http://imgur.com/m3Pstj7).\n\nBut, just like any other situation, one incident isn't enough. After the /nuke explosion, the server was turned into a [**faction server**](http://imgur.com/EpEFG0B)\n\nLuckily, Chris eventually changed back to creative, after +/- 2 days. At this point, we could see various [**members**](http://imgur.com/pr4h5qq).\n\nThe server was growing once again!\n\n---\n\n#To be continued...",
