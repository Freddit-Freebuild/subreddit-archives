If you want to build in RPCity, you ask the Mayor. If you have suggestions for RPCity, you ask the Mayor. If something happened to your build in RPCity, you go to the Mayor, which in turn, if there was a grief that he didn't approve, will go to Staff.\n\n#RPCity rules\n\nRPCity rules will be assembled by the Staff. The RPCity Mayor will have to enforce these rules in order to, for example, explain why a build was moved.\n\n**The RPCity Mayor cannot abuse his power.** If he removed your build and it wasn't against the RPCity rules, you have a right to come to Staff and tell us about it.\n\n#Custom Prefix\n\nThe RPCity Mayor will have his own Custom Prefix indicating he's the Mayor. He will also have a discord rank. \n\n#The RPCity Mayor will have OP.\n\nHe cannot abuse it, though, or use it for other purpouses other than RPCity related business.\n\n#RPCity Mayor's responsibilities\n\nTo take care of RPCity and keep it organized, well-running, and the people who participate in it well-treated.\n\nHe must **always** warn someone before he does something to their build.

He can modify the rules of RPCity (he will have to ask Staff first and he will have to have the RPCity builders' interest as the top priority), he can modify the CSS of the sub, he can modify the discord, even make a banner and shit.\n\nPeople can also suggest stuff to the Mayor, he can set up a poll (to see what the RPCity community thinks) and then do the changes.\n\n---\n\n**The RPCity Mayor won't be permanent, unless everyone is fine with it**. There will be more than one election, and depending on the Mayor's job, it can be soon or in the future.\n\n---\n\n#APPLY FOR RPCITY MAYOR HERE!\n\nJust comment down below:\n\n- **Username:**\n\n- **Rank:**\n\n- **Contributions to RPCity you've done**:\n\n- **Do you already have plans?

If yes, what those might be?:                \n**A museum of art which players can use sketchmap for.**                              \n**Exciting new RPs full of adventure.**              \n**My own team of builders that I hope will be very helpful.**                \n**No guarantees, but maybe a tree house out in the woods.**                  \n**I will be responsible and rational-thinking when being mayor, and will tell all staff about any build-editing that wasn't permitted.**                                      \nWhy you want to be the Mayor: I've been participating in this RP since it began, and it's quite extraordinary how well it's developed, considering past RPs didn't have a good reception (FNAF High, etc.) I feel it's time for me to become more involved in RPCity by becoming Mayor. I think becoming mayor will also help me become more professional, so then one day I can apply that professionalism to try and become a staff member.",
