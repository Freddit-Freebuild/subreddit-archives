The removal of this post will only solidify that.\n\nSo here I am, Depend, ex-admin of Freddit Freebuild.\n\nLet's create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.\n\n#Contention 1: \"\"\"\"Staff\"\"\"\"\n\nBeing a staff member had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit's staff was just fluff. Head-Co-Mod[+] or whatever. Basically all of the staff roles were fucking useless until Manager where you would have finite permissions.\n\nMoving on from the fundamental flaws, the staff team itself has never been good.\n\nI've seen 2 good staff members. Random and Zen.\n\nJAFC - Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn't be allowed to run servers.\n\nZoo - A fucking lunatic with an ego bigger than thought to be possible.\n\nAxe - Literal figurehead. Pretty much a scapegoat but also shitty.\n\nSven - Jesus I don't even know where to begin, so I don't know if I can.\n\nPsy - One of the worst staff members I think I've seen anywhere. Imagine a big intimidating balloon, except it pops if you look at it weirdly.\n\nKeep in mind, these are or have been some of the top people in charge of the server. If I was talking about all staff, people like Steam would be filling up this post. Alas, I don't have the time for that.\n\n#Contention 2: Waving and Woger\n\nWoger - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.\n\nWaving - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for mgs.\n\nFor some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Waving) has been banned over some stupid grudges. \n\nAm i here to defend Waving and Woger? No they can eat dicks. Am I here for the staff then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely retarded. You created \"wars\", specifically comprised of downtime for regular players and fucking meaningless tension. All because you're fucking little kids who can't handle a situation like this with player convenience in mind.\n\n#Contention 3: Hip Memes\n\nShitposts were, are, and will always be rampant. Is this bad? Not necessarily. Until you consider that the fucking TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER are the honchos. Not trusted users. The fucking leaders flood the chat with their cancerous immature memes.\n\nYou know who likes reading the bee movie script? Fucking no one.\n\nThe fan-fictions, while they may be intentionally shittily written, were pushed as the face of Freddit's comedy. Were they funny? No. Not because they were edgy, but because they were so over the top. Make a pastiche of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Zoo's fanfics.\n\n#Contention 4: Companies\n\nthey're not real fuck off. i have over 200 screenshots of the inside of every company hq.\n\n#Final Contention: \"Guys let's fix things\"\n\nThe staff team is fucking incompetent. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\nThere's drama.\n\nWhy the fuck?\n\nNo, you fucking mouthbreather, it's not normal drama. Someone pulling the strings must have a stiffy for the drama because it's relentless and petty.\n\nAny time the staff tries to revise or reform things, they get shittier.\n\nSpawn is literally dogshit.\n\nReformed staff team is literally dogshit.\n\nThis was the final proof to me that the staff team, Sven and Zoo in particular, are far more incompetent than I thought a human being could be. They're so wallowed in their own ego-boners, that I'll actually be amazed if they let this post stay up.\n\nTo anyone who's read this, thank you.\n\nFreddit has gone from shit to fucking actual trash. I won't be coming back, and I urge you out there to move on to other things.\n\nFuck.\n\n~Depend\n\nPs: None of your \"\"\"comics\"\"\", \"\"\"shows\"\"\", or \"\"\"stories\"\"\" are interesting nor original in the slightest.",

Everyone's welcomed to give me feedback about what I do, in fact in the fucking changelog I put between parenthisis that you can suggest color combination for ranks and you can suggest other shit to the server.\n\nChris gave me feedback and I talked to him on discord, and some stuff he said I agreed that could be changed (example the spawn). This? This here? This is you thinking you're the best and you're above all these \"retards\" and you can insult anyone because we're not human beings with our own set of troubles. The only inflated ego here is yours, Depend, literally coming back from an unannounced hiatus to shit on people who actually stayed and tried to make this place a better place.\n\nNo you dont get to call us names and disrespect us after you go on a monthly hiatus with no idea of what was going on in the server, just to come back thinking you're the best and above everyone and call people out, people who sticked around and at least fucking tried to keep this place up.\n\n**EDIT:** You complain about drama happening everyday, which is not true and if you had been online for the past weeks youd know that, but literally makes a post which causes drama. Lmfao, depend, you're so hypocritical.\n\nAnd your comments about the comics? Just plain bashing out users for HAVING FUN, so basically you want Freddit to not be toxic, but youre literally bringing down things that people have fun making or reading, and creating unneccessary drama and insulting people left and right. Literally making this place more and more toxic in the proccess. \n\nYou call Woger a edgelord but youre literally the one acting all edgy and rebellious look at me I can swear and call people insulting names hey hey if you remove this youre proving you have a massive ego heee nevermind me coming out of a hiatus thinking im the best around here and disrespecting everyone this is not having an ego i repeat zoo has an ego not me.\n\nNobody ever said the fanfictions were funny. They were made to gross people out. We havent played a fanfiction for months, and they were made in **EARLY 2016** before you even joined this place. Of course you would know the fanfics havent been played in months if you were... yknow, ACTUALLY ON THE SERVER. But lets judge freddit based on what it was before, fuck whatever improvements they made, lets just make a random ass rant that calls people out.\n\nLets not forget, you say \"guys wtf companies are jokes\" which we all know, yet you have **200 FUCKING SCREENSHOTS OF \"COMPANIES HQs\"**. 200?!! Jesus calm down man I thought companies were just a joke and not real... hm.\n\nSo go be salty on another server. One thing is an opinion, \"Zoo I think spawn is dogshit.\" another is an attack, \"Zoo you lunatic with a gigantic ego fuck off with your company spawn is dogshit and this and that freddit is toxic aaaa\".",

If you think you're all above every single one of us here, then the only egotistical one is you, Depend. At least try to make your opinions the slightest bit respectful and stop going \"Fuck you all everything you do is awful, get off this server\". Hell no, we're not getting off this server just because some disrespectful ex-admin comes back to make an offensive post like this. How about next time, you state your opinions in a less rude, readable, negotiable manner?",

If you think you&amp;#39;re all above every single one of us here, then the only egotistical one is you, Depend. At least try to make your opinions the slightest bit respectful and stop going &amp;quot;Fuck you all everything you do is awful, get off this server&amp;quot;. Hell no, we&amp;#39;re not getting off this server just because some disrespectful ex-admin comes back to make an offensive post like this.
