He stretched his white, muscular arms, barely contained by his blue and gold armor. He reached up and scratched the three sprigs of hair on his head before looking down at the\u2026\n\nDarkness. Pure darkness. No, not darkness \u2013 nothingness. Not a room devoid of light, but a room devoid of everything. A room devoid of room.\n\n*Devoid. De void. Da void. The void. Holy shit.*\n\n\u201cGamora? Where are you?\u201d stuttered Greg. He continued down the stairs, closer to the room in which a room no longer was. He called out once more, \u201cGamora? Nebula? Anyone?\u201d\n\nAs he inched closer to the bottom of the stairs, he began to feel just how cold it was. It started with a mild chill, but the temperature only got lower and lower until it felt like he was standing in the middle of a blizzard. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked himself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where is everyone? Where is everything?\u201d Unsure of what else to do, he decided to go back upstairs, not noticing that the stairs themselves had started disappearing into the darkness as well.\n\n\u201cMaybe I can climb out a window,\u201d Greg thought to himself as he returned to his bedroom. He made his way to the curtains and parted them, anticipating the shock of bright sunlight only to be met with nothing. The darkness was outside as well. Greg touched the glass, dumbfounded, before pulling away in pain. \u201cOw,\u201d he muttered, rubbing his stinging fingers. The glass was too cold \u2013 so cold, it burned.\n\nGreg was already frightened, but it was only now that he began to panic. His stomach dropped, his breath hastened, and his head felt lighter than air. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Greg mumbled to himself, \u201cThis is a lucid dream. It has to be. There\u2019s no way this is happening. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s not.\u201d If he was dreaming, it was only a matter of time before he panicked so hard that his brain would scare itself awake. \u201cAny moment now,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cCome on. Come on.\u201d\n\nAlas, that moment never came. This wasn\u2019t a dream.\n\nWhat do you do in a situation like this? Are you supposed to react? How? Do you breathe out and smile, looking back on your life and embracing the end with dignity? Do you fall to your knees in anguish, begging God or science or apekind to save you?  Before Greg had the chance to ask or answer these questions, he felt the burning cold again. This time, it was all over his back. He turned around only to find that the void had somehow made its way through the closed window and into the room, slowly absorbing whatever it touched. He just barely managed to dodge it before running out of the room, but to his horror, he saw that the void was continuing to close in from both ends of the hallway. There was nowhere left to go.\n\nGreg was speechless at first, looking around and behind himself as his room and the hallway were swallowed by darkness. As the whole of existence grew smaller and smaller, a single tear rolled down his cheek, and he sighed with resignation. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s so over.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, something began to stir in front of him. A glowing, lime green fluid began to spill from thin air, flowing around and around until it took the form of a swirling portal. A gravelly voice called from the other side, \u201cNo\u2026you\u2019re so back!\u201d Greg looked at the gateway curiously before the voice called again, \u201cDon\u2019t just stare at it like an idiot! Jump in!\u201d With no other options, an uncertain but very desperate Greg Thanos leapt into the slimy vortex. As the portal dissipated, so did the rest of the house.\n\n*And all was dark.*",
