Why not just destroy it?\n\nHovertal: As silly as it sounds, we had enough equipment already to just bury it. We'd have to file documentation for a demolishing procedure, and we don't need that. Especially not now.\n\nEmployee: Well, we have nobody to blame but ourselves. Those suits were unstable anyway, ESPECIALLY the Spring Piggy model used in the diner. Not to mention that \"Funtime\" yellow Toady animatronic used in the private party room.\n\nHovertal: Toadtoad.\n\nEmployee: What?\n\nHovertal: Toady is the white \"revamped\" character. The yellow one is Toadtoad. Just like the yellow Fruity is called Fruitjuice.\n\nEmployee: People are gonna be confused by that. I saw the records for a Funtime Toady model plus a Funtime Bill model, whatever happened to those?\n\nHovertal: The advanced technology proved to be...unstable. The only reason we used Funtime Toadtoad in Piggy's Funtime Diner was because it was the first Funtime animatronic, before the Bill and Toady models.\n\nEmployee: What about the, I dunno, 10 random prototype bots you created before then?\n\nHovertal: Let's just say there was an...extremely severe problem with the AI programming.\n\nEmployee: Ugh...so, the springlock suits are gonna be locked up too, right?\n\nHovertal: Only the Spring Piggy. Spring Toady and Spring Fruity have been converted to an animatronic form and their location is being reopened.\n\nEmployee: What the hell!? But we already spent a fortune on those upgraded yellow models! The ones you mentioned earlier! Toadtoad &amp; Fruitjuice!\n\nHovertal: Yes, I've decided they'll just be used here in the private party room.\n\nEmployee: Ugh. Anyway, while I'm here, I was curious about the origin of these characters.\n\nHovertal: They're in memory of the founders of the city we've built the locations in.\n\nEmployee: Yeah...I can never remember it's name...or the name of the new location for that matter. What were they again?\n\nHovertal: **Toady's Family Pizzeria will be opening soon in New Toadtown.**\n",
