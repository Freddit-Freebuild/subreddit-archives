I was banned for almost all of 2017 but I\u2019ve improved and I\u2019ve for sure learned my lesson damn well. We\u2019ve got a new RP world, but it may distract others from their builds on other worlds, and it makes them twice as vulnerable to griefs. I\u2019m here to fix that, and keep the community stable and make sure it doesn\u2019t fall apart.
