Through his helmet, a gooey green smile can be seen.\n\n**\u201cNINE!\u201d**\n\nAn inkling girl and a Psychanic unit are looking out a large office window at the crowd outside below. The Psychanic looks down a photograph of the two of them wearing party hats with an old, shriveled man in a coat. He puts it down and looks away, sighing, before the girl puts a hand on his shoulder. \n\n**\u201cEIGHT!\u201d**\n\nSomeone in a panda onesie relaxes on a park bench while playing a rendition of \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d on a ukulele. \n\n**\u201cSEVEN!\u201d**\n\nA teenage boy with rainbow gradient skin munches on Christmas cookies while watching the event on television with two older humans. \n\n**\u201cSIX!\u201d**\n\nA voluptuous female ghost with vibrant green hair and a red jacket flies excitedly around the event, giving a few attendees surprise hugs.\n\n**\u201cFIVE!\u201d**\n\nA private party is being held in an office building. Two men stand on the balcony. One is a cakeman in a blue and yellow suit. The other appears to be human. He is wearing a black suit and is wearing a thick helmet that covers his entire head. A skull is painted on the face. He feels the helmet and, upon seeing a nod from the cakeman, he presses a small switch to unlock and remove the helmet, revealing a disfigured face. Although these two have had their differences, corporate rivalry could not get in the way of a celebration\u2026or their former friendship.\n\n**\u201cFOUR!\u201d**\n\nA younger anthro rabbit girl nuzzles against a large anthro pineapple woman, who uses her other arm to embrace a short, yellow-skinned humanoid man. At their feet, a white feral rabbit and a small flat-faced dog run around happily. \n\n**\u201cTHREE!\u201d**\n\nFrom the dark treeline, another anthro rabbit, this one grey and severely obese, observes cheerful people in the street. He lets out a nasally chuckle before turning around and moving deeper into Reversal Forest. \n\n**\u201cTWO!\u201d**\n\nAn old man with tanned skin and curly hair shakes his head while watching the celebration on television. He rings a bell at his bedside. A servant enters the room, asking, \u201cHow can I help you, Mr. Freebuild?\u201d The old man says, \u201cWrite The Broccoli Company a check for one hundred million dollars, and send my sincerest congratulations to Zooman Canadanda.\u201d  \n\n**\u201cONE!\u201d**\n\nNothing. A flash of bright white light that covered the entire city. Complete nothingness. The cheers, the love, the happiness, the one hundred million dollar check\u2026none of it came to be. The old man was right: this place could not exist in the year 2020. It could not sustain itself. In a field of white, only one thing remained: a small, white car driving through the void. It came to a gentle stop before the door opened and the driver steps out; a large, black ape. He looks around before sighing, and speaks.   \n \n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re young or old, happy or heartbroken, loved or lonely\u2026none of it matters, has mattered, or will matter when you\u2019re just a gorilla in a coupe.\u201d He gets back in the car and drives off.  \n \n\nHappy new year, Freddit.",
