This is just your suggestion, you can get a different rank you were aiming for):\n\nDo you have a way for us to contact you outside Minecraft? If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc):\n\nFuture activity (how active you'll be in the near future):\n\nPrior experience:\n\nNotable skills:\n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?:\n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:\n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:\n\nWhy should you be staff?

Id let one persom speak and explain their side of story, then the next. Id listen to them without bias, and logically determine who was right, who griefed, who lied, or whatever.

If it was a shitstorm id breifly mute everyone temproarily and tell them to take it to the drama channel in discord, then I would unmute them. In the drama channel, Id let them try to sort it out and find a solution to it.\n\nThanks, Ryan",

This is just your suggestion, you can get a different rank you were aiming for): Moderator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a way for us to contact you outside Minecraft? If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): Discord is Sodasaurus, Skype is @captainsoda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture activity (how active you'll be in the near future): I've stated this in my past application, I'll try to be as active as I can be, if I ever go inactive, it's more due to personal things, or traveling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior experience: Moderator twice on Freddit, Admin one time, Modmin one time as well, and Helper this time. On other servers, not a lot, but just enough. I've been Admin a couple times, Moderator. And that's about it really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable skills: I don't have much, I can help, I can build a few things here and there, I'm currently working on a FNAF:SL build, and a build for an upcoming comic. ;) As well I can watch over the server when needed, I get on as soon as I get off from school.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: I am already staff technically, but if I do become Moderator however, I will do the same as I do Helper, except better? I should say? I'd probably double task, look over everyb ody, build some, look over, watch chat, repeat.  I'll try to do what I can if I get Mod.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Eh, depends. Like stated, Watch over players, Make sure no harm's done, I'd look at chat most of the time, If drama unveils, I'll stay away, say a word or two and back off in order to prevent the drama. The others can call me any other time if they want me to help on a few things. Give me a job, and I'll do it, even if I'm lazy, I'll force myself lol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: \nA lot, group manager, essentials, NPCs, The usual. Worldedit, WorldGuard, citizens, plotsquared, I know others, but I can't really think of them at the moment.they're simple, but I tend to easily get the gist most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I'm generally a good guy, I'm immature sometimes, and sometimes not. I don't try enough is what I feel,  Helper is good, I like it. But I feel like my job isn't really doing much, I feel like I should stop being dumb, Quit playing around and actually do something for once. I promise to follow rules, staff, even players if that's nessacary. I will happily allow to get criticism from the staff or owners, so they can tell me what I'm doing wrong/what I need to do, in which, Sven or new owner, if you have anything you would like to tell me/teach me, I'd happily listen and I'll follow by that just fine. I've apologized for my past, and I do not wanna be \"immature Nathan\", that does spamming /mail sendall, or anything like that. I'm taking my old ways, placing them aside, And move the fuck on lmao I will help anybody in game or in the chat, whether it would be commands, or general help. I do anything I'm told to, I also need to watch my mouth in front of Zen and Cait. (Sorry guys),  hopefully I can be a good Moderator, if I do get it. I'm sorry for things I've done, I wanna say thank you all for being on Freddit and thank you Chris and Sven for making it. If it was never made, I'd probably not be here right now, or probably wouldn't have met all of you. Thank you all so much &lt;3 i know this one was a tad bit shorter, but I had to take out every thought i had. Also, *here's a thing that I said in an old application, just to add on a bit.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\nWhat you will bring to the table: I've been staff on Freddit two times in my life, one as a cringy Admin, and recently a moderator before it was shut down. I may seem like I don't do my job most of the time, but hopefully I can't be dumb anymore and actually do my fucking job, I will pay attention to chat, whether it would be somebody needing help or needing a command, or some staff asking me something, etc, It may seem stupid when I say this but I don't do much, but I can do as much stuff to be useful. If JAFC needs anything else for me to say here or needs me to do anything more on the server, I'll happily catch on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright well there ya go.",

I would notify in advanced if it does.\n\nPrior experience: Co-Owner on smaller servers, mod on a tekkit server, on this server I've been mod-headmod-mod-headmod-admin-headadmin-manager-headmod\n\nNotable skills: I'm pretty good at telling if someone is bullshitting me, and I can find info pretty easily.\n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: I'm already planning on a fuck ton of events, currently the Christmas event is in the works. As staff I'd be able to advertise easily and get everyone playing the event by the rules.\n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: I can easily rollback any griefs, most players listen to me. Again I'd like to make monthly server events, to make this server have a sense of a fun community again.\n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: ban, kick, tempban, co I, v, d, rollback, pex, and pretty much everything else needed.\n\nWhy should you be staff?: I've been staff on the server for a while and I don't know if I'd be getting the boot this time around, so it's nice to be safe and have this here anyways. I think I've been a great member of the staff team in the past, besides a few fuck ups on my part, and I think if I keep staff I'd be able to implement some sweet events for the rest of the server.\n",
