It can\u2019t be this soon!  \n**Employee 1:** It\u2019s crazy, Frank\u2026 we\u2019ve been down here for so long that we\u2019ve lost track of time\u2026 do you even remember the last time you left the facility?  \n\n*A jingle plays from above. This is the announcement system.*  \n\n**Orb:** Good evening, employees, this is Dr. Orb speaking\u2026 as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, it\u2019s Christmas Eve.  \nEmployee from distant lab: What? Already?  \n**Orb:** \u2026so, a small celebration will be held in the surface auditorium. Be there by quarter past or miss out on the announcement.  \n\n*The jingle plays again, signaling the end of the transmission.*\n\n**Employee 1:** What do you think he\u2019s gonna announce this time?  \n**Employee 2:** I swear, if this is just about some new testing track or another damn psychanic iteration\u2026   \n**Employee 1:** It\u2019ll probably just be another damn business report like last year.  \n\n*The two leave their lab and head to the surface staircase. On the way, they\u2019re joined by a test subject.*\n\n**Employee 2:** Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in one of the testing chambers?  \n**Test subject:** A panel slid open right after Orb\u2019s announcement while I was testing, so I left the chamber through it. After all, we test subjects still count as employees.  \n**Employee 1:** Pfft, yeah, as if.  \n**Test subject:** Shush pippo. \n\n*They reach the surface building and head to the auditorium. All of OrbCorp\u2019s staff is assembled there and the only lights are focused on an empty stage. Employee 1 and 2 and the test subject sit down as they wait for Orb\u2019s announcement. Suddenly, Ballonz, OrbCorp's first successful psychanic, appears on the stage.*\n\n**Ballonz:** Please sit down and remain quiet, everybody. Our founder and CEO, Dr. C. Orb, is about to deliver an important announcement. Thank you.\n\n*Ballonz leaves the stage and the crowd goes silent. After a few seconds, Orb appears on stage.*\n\n**Orb:** Greetings, employees. You\u2019re all probably wondering why I collected you here. Well, first off, I must congratulate you for all your hard work that you did this year. We reached true consciousness in the psychanic project, some new testing tracks were opened for the portal device, and most important of all: the facility didn\u2019t blow up! Great work all.   \n\n*Nobody laughs at his joke.*\n\n**Orb:** Anyways, today is an important day. Not just because of Christmas. This day will go down in company history.\nThe crowd starts whispering and asking questions.  \n**Orb:** Now, now. You see, I understand that you haven\u2019t left the facility in quite some time and that you\u2019d love to spend time with your families and friends again. Well, how convenient for you! Because from now on you\u2019re all fired.  \n\n*The crowd shouts in uproar.*  \n\n**Orb:** You see, the psychanics are human-like now thanks to you. And to be honest, they\u2019re the better employees. They don\u2019t need payment, they don\u2019t need food, water, nor sleep. Despite their true consciousness, you can reprogram them to obey by your orders without questioning\u2026 they\u2019re the perfect employees.  \n**Employee 1:** But this job isn\u2019t even that well-paying- how the heck am I going to find another job so soon?  \n**Employee 2:** How the heck are we supposed to return to normal life after this?   \n**Test subject:** I don\u2019t know, guys\u2026 I think I\u2019m more than okay with this\u2026  \n**Orb:** Of course, you can\u2019t get proper test results by using robots instead of humans, so you test subjects are safe.  \n\n*More uproar. Suddenly, psychanics enter the room from every door and start escorting all employees.*\n\n**Orb:** It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you, ladies and gentlemen. But... this is for the better good of my research.\n\n***December 24th, 2016***\n\n*Orb is standing behind is desk, looking over the facility through the window. Ballonz enters the room.*\n\n**Ballonz:** I\u2019m heading out to Reversal City for Christmas, Orb. Is that okay?  \n**Orb:** Absolutely, Ballz. Heck, stay there for as long as you want to.   \n**Ballonz:** Thanks, Orb!  \n**Orb:**  You know, it\u2019s been four years since I replaced my staff with psychanics. Sometimes I wonder what they\u2019re up to these days\u2026 but in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter.  \n\n*Ballonz walks up to the window and looks out with Orb.* \n\n**Orb:** You robots are better workers than the humans ever were anyways. It\u2019s a strange feeling. I can make anything happen with a finger click. My employees are truly reprogrammable now, making them my toys in a way. It\u2019s like this facility is my kingdom and the machinery obeys me like peasants obey their king...  \n**Ballonz:** Haha, don\u2019t get power hungry, Orb. \n\n*Orb laughs.*\n\n**Orb:** What? It\u2019s true though!  \n\n*Orb turns to face Ballonz directly.*\n\n**Orb:** Merry Christmas, Ballz, and a happy new year.  \n**Ballonz:** Same to you, Orb.  \n\n*Ballonz leaves Orb\u2019s office and Orb faces to the window again. He sighs.*\n\n~~------------------------------------------~~\n\n*This was going to be a short comic as a way to celebrate Christmas (yeah, I celebrate Christmas by posting short stories about people getting fired from stable jobs, get with the times, people), but since the npc plugin is a pain in the ass right now I decided to post this in text form. Ever wondered why OrbCorp doesn't have that many actual employees? Well now you know!*\n\n*Merry Christmas y'all, and a happy new year.*\n\n*-Your favourite doctor.*\n",
