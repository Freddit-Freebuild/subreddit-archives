But I, being one myself, disagree on this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Emil Orb's biggest legacy was not his psychanics, nor was it the advancements to the scientific field that he brought. No, this is something my Father confided in me: My Father's biggest legacy, in his own view, was the development of toiletry that would talk to you to keep you entertained as you went about your business.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Technically this could count as part of his psychanic revolution, but for some reason I yet to have uncipher, he insisted the two were separate.

Whether this will affect the following year's Psychanic unit sales is **unknown** as of now.\n* **IMPERSONATIONS OF THE DEAD:** Various sold Psychanic units have been reported to awaken at night to exclaim they were the **reincarnations of Dr. Emil Orb** and reported what they saw beyond the veil of death as a shadowy landscape with structures barely resembling the architecture of Reversal Point City. Afterwards the Psychanic units would shut down and have no recollection of the event. Orbital confirms that these are, in fact, **not** the reincarnations of Dr. Orb, but are happy to recall these units to have them replaced.\n* **REDECORATED REVERSAL POINT CITY COMPLEX:** The central building from which Orbital operates from within the city, the **Orbital Complex**, has undergone a variety of renovations to make the building more accessible to the public, including an open **testing applications office** and a **company history museum** commemorating the legacy of Emil Orb and the history of the company.\n* **WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL DAY APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN:** In order to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the second World War, Orbital has partnered up with **FazCo**, the **City Council Historian's Department**, and **UNESCO** to organize an event to reenact the **Invasion of Normandy**, where participants will fight alongside Faztions and Psychanics as they storm the beach. The Event will take place on **Chumbruh Coast** and applications are open in the Reversal City History Museum until March 30th 2020 (Warning: The event will feature live rounds and ammunition and may result in your death, which no involved party will take liability for. Seek post-life resurrection institutions to ensure your safety at the event.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Transparency reports for the* ***CMD TECH***, ***TPS DETECTOR***, &amp; ***O.C.T.O.B.E.R.*** *facilities will be published later this year.*",

Whether this will affect the following year&amp;#39;s Psychanic unit sales is &lt;strong&gt;unknown&lt;/strong&gt; as of now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPERSONATIONS OF THE DEAD:&lt;/strong&gt; Various sold Psychanic units have been reported to awaken at night to exclaim they were the &lt;strong&gt;reincarnations of Dr. Emil Orb&lt;/strong&gt; and reported what they saw beyond the veil of death as a shadowy landscape with structures barely resembling the architecture of Reversal Point City. Afterwards the Psychanic units would shut down and have no recollection of the event. Orbital confirms that these are, in fact, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the reincarnations of Dr. Orb, but are happy to recall these units to have them replaced.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REDECORATED REVERSAL POINT CITY COMPLEX:&lt;/strong&gt; The central building from which Orbital operates from within the city, the &lt;strong&gt;Orbital Complex&lt;/strong&gt;, has undergone a variety of renovations to make the building more accessible to the public, including an open &lt;strong&gt;testing applications office&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;company history museum&lt;/strong&gt; commemorating the legacy of Emil Orb and the history of the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL DAY APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN:&lt;/strong&gt; In order to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the second World War, Orbital has partnered up with &lt;strong&gt;FazCo&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;City Council Historian&amp;#39;s Department&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;UNESCO&lt;/strong&gt; to organize an event to reenact the &lt;strong&gt;Invasion of Normandy&lt;/strong&gt;, where participants will fight alongside Faztions and Psychanics as they storm the beach. The Event will take place on &lt;strong&gt;Chumbruh Coast&lt;/strong&gt; and applications are open in the Reversal City History Museum until March 30th 2020 (Warning: The event will feature live rounds and ammunition and may result in your death, which no involved party will take liability for. Seek post-life resurrection institutions to ensure your safety at the event.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency reports for the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CMD TECH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TPS DETECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;O.C.T.O.B.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;facilities will be published later this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
