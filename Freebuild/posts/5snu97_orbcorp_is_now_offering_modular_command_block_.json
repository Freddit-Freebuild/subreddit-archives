OrbCorp has just the thing for you: **Modular command block system installations.** You can now pay OrbCorp technicians to come to your location to install the following machines:\n\n-\tMEDIQUICK UNITS  \nThese heal you, remove any active effects, and extinguish you in case you\u2019re burning alive. A true marvel of modern medicine.\n\n-\tAUTO-REPLENISHING CHESTS  \nTired of having to refill your chests because your customers/employees keep emptying them? Store items in a template chest that gets copied over to a main chest each time it\u2019s used. Useful for storing written books/duping ZT.\n\n-\tCOMBINATION LOCK DOORS  \nStore a combination in a template block and have people open the door only when they get the said combination right. Works with rare items too, allowing for company-specific keycards, for example. Or to torture test subjects with puzzles. \n\n-\tCLOSE-RANGE TELEPORTATION PADS (EXPERIMENTAL! SUBJECT TO CHANGE.)  \nHave two teleportation pads installed within a short range of each other to travel between them quickly. This technology is experimental, however, and may lead to your erasure from this timeline. Success rates lie at 20%.\n\n\nFor a demonstration of each of these technologies visit the OrbCorp train station in Reversal City. If you want one of these installed at your place, then *send a mail to DrOrb*. Installations will only happen when you\u2019re online to make sure that we don\u2019t fuck up. \n\nCost: 0 ZT/P *because both are fucking worthless.*\nThank you for showing interest in the Orbital Corporation and its products! If you care about these products and show interest in improving their quality, sign up for testing today.\n\n^^^^^^^^orbcorpisnotresponsibleforanydeaths/timelineerasures.\n",
