Manager for a little while, but that one doesn&amp;#39;t really count because it was a mistake&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable skills:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m really good with commands, and I know how everything works. I can do basically anything server related.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; Try to keep active and help people out, give some cool ideas for some cool stuff (very cool), and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly how you&amp;#39;d expect! I&amp;#39;ll try to help out when things aren&amp;#39;t working properly, check out griefs and fix them, etc, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:&lt;/strong&gt; I know pretty much all of them, and I also know that the plugin versions of ban and kick don&amp;#39;t work much anymore, and the vanilla commands work better.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should you be staff?&lt;/strong&gt; (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I want to try to help out the server again, because they&amp;#39;ve given me another chance, and it&amp;#39;s been a really cool place to be at. So I&amp;#39;m hoping I can get another chance at this, too. Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
