If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): I use Discord. And you can PM me too on reddit.    \n\nFuture activity (how active you'll be in the near future): On weekdays, I can be active at 3 PM, but less active at 5-7 PM. On weekends, I can be active from 8 AM, less active at 10:40 AM to 1 PM, and more active the rest of the day.    \n\nPrior experience: Helper, Mod, Head-Mod, Admin.    \n\nNotable skills: I have knowledge of how to rollback with CoreProtect, I can rank up, give prefixes, give suffixes. I can also help with a few plugins such as SketchMap or furniture.    \n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: As a Helper, I will try stopping rule-breaking, such as build-editting and disrespecting. I will rarely permaban unless it's something really serious, like a bigass grief on spawn. I will also help with people, telling them how to get ranks, how to use plugins, copy and pasting builds for them, I'll basically make sure everything's normal. As a Mod, it'll be much more than just making sure everything's ok. I will be much more helpful, and will attempt to calm the drama. I will start taking of people who break multiple rules, such as racism, and spamming. I will tempmute people who spam for 2 minutes, and tempmute total assholes for 10 minutes. I will help the server even more and put a nice smile on your faces, and I will help with spawn-building. Overall, a very helpful moderator/helpful is what my goal is.    \n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Good with pretty much every commands needed to know. Good at cleaning griefs. Going to start calming drama. I will permaban, tempban, mute or kick rule-breakers.    \nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: /essentials:kick, /essentials:tempban, /essentials:ban, /kick, /tempmute    \n\nWhy should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I want to be staff so I can do something to help the server become more better. I love this community even though it's cancer sometimes, and I know I've fucked up and as I said in my last thread, I want to fix those mistakes by becoming staff again, and becoming a satisfactory - maybe even superb staff member.\n",

If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): I use Discord. And you can PM me too on reddit.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Future activity (how active you&amp;#39;ll be in the near future): On weekdays, I can be active at 3 PM, but less active at 5-7 PM. On weekends, I can be active from 8 AM, less active at 10:40 AM to 1 PM, and more active the rest of the day.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior experience: Helper, Mod, Head-Mod, Admin.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notable skills: I have knowledge of how to rollback with CoreProtect, I can rank up, give prefixes, give suffixes. I can also help with a few plugins such as SketchMap or furniture.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your plans for when you become staff?: As a Helper, I will try stopping rule-breaking, such as build-editting and disrespecting. I will rarely permaban unless it&amp;#39;s something really serious, like a bigass grief on spawn. I will also help with people, telling them how to get ranks, how to use plugins, copy and pasting builds for them, I&amp;#39;ll basically make sure everything&amp;#39;s normal. As a Mod, it&amp;#39;ll be much more than just making sure everything&amp;#39;s ok. I will be much more helpful, and will attempt to calm the drama. I will start taking of people who break multiple rules, such as racism, and spamming. I will tempmute people who spam for 2 minutes, and tempmute total assholes for 10 minutes. I will help the server even more and put a nice smile on your faces, and I will help with spawn-building. Overall, a very helpful moderator/helpful is what my goal is.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Good with pretty much every commands needed to know. Good at cleaning griefs. Going to start calming drama. I will permaban, tempban, mute or kick rule-breakers.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: /essentials:kick, /essentials:tempban, /essentials:ban, /kick, /tempmute    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should you be staff? (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.): I want to be staff so I can do something to help the server become more better. I love this community even though it&amp;#39;s cancer sometimes, and I know I&amp;#39;ve fucked up and as I said in my last thread, I want to fix those mistakes by becoming staff again, and becoming a satisfactory - maybe even superb staff member.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If yes, elaborate how (discord, skype, etc): Yes. [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheyCallMeArab), [Reddit DMs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/), and Discord (TheyCallMeArab#8028)\n\nFuture activity (how active you'll be in the near future): I've started to get more involved with Freddit and will be active in the future.\n\nPrior experience: Was an Admin on James' creative server.\n\nNotable skills: Knows a lot of worldedit commands and familiar with the core protect plugin.\n\nWhat are your plans for when you become staff?: Helping the server even more than before now that I have a staff rank. \n\nIn what ways can you help the server once you get staff?: Being fair to everyone, banning greifers with fair ban times. Just being fair.\n\nWhat Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?: /ban, /ipban, /op, /deop, /setwarp, /setspawn, /mute, /unmute, /kick, the basics really.\n\nWhy should you be staff?: I've been on Freddit since mid to late July 2015, and I've never had a staff position, yet. I've seen the server at its peak and and it's lowest. Being a staff member would be an amazing privilege to have. Being a staff member on a server that is my only excuse why I log into Minecraft  everyday, huh? The server has so much potential, but we gotta work to make it amazing. Right now, Freddit is probably the best I've seen it, imo, however we make it even better. That is all I have to say. Good luck to everyone else applying.",
