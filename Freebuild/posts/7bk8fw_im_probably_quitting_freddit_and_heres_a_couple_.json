The most users I see everyday are 2-3, and even that's becoming rarer. Now, I get it-- it's the most inactive time of the year, but the Discord is so much more active that it really feels like the server is truly dying.\n\n\n**Part 2:** Deterioration of the server. Hovertal is gone for one, so that absolutely sucks. I missed that. The server is also completely piled with griefs. I'm serious. Just go to spawn, check it out! It's a gallery of griefs! There seems to be nothing new happening, either. I heard Sven was adding a roller coaster plugin: something he's just pulled from the shelf of Spigot, no doubt. Sounds really special, doesn't it? Instead of a cool plugin made just for us, it's just... there. Equal to any other plugin.\n\n\n**Part 3:** Staff. Let's be honest here, the staff are not very good right now. I'm not trying to mindlessly offend anyone, but it's just a fact that the current staff team is not good. I'm going to break-down all of the staff members, but instead of just offending them, I'm going to try to actually state the problems with them and how they moderate the server:\n\n1. Zoo. I'd consider Zoo the 'community owner'. That is NOT a bad thing. He monitors the community and deals with most drama situations. This is all fine, but... He's letting the server deteriorate. He's not focusing on it. He's also not all that active in my experience, but I might just think that due to our timezones.\n\n\n2. Sven. The 'server owner'. He works on the server and does what he can to improve it-- but he doesn't seem to really add all that much. And when he does, it's usually removed. He also seems to be restricted from doing anything else-- if he makes a community decision, all of staff backlash instantly.\n\n\n3. Zelda. He... doesn't really do much of anything. He's on Discord often sure, and he does solve some problems on there, but he doesn't really do much staff related... I mean, he moves people to respective channels, but... that doesn't really count.\n\n\n4. Orb. Orb seems to be the most active on the server. He likes to make cool things and work on Reversal City and Orbcorp. He does ban people sometimes, but it feels more like he uses his staff rank just to make cool things. Not saying that's bad-- but he's left and rejoined staff multiple times for a reason. He doesn't really do much of the staff stuff.\n\n\n5. Milk. Active on the Discord, and that's about it. Last time I tried to get him to do staff things he got frustrated at me. Doesn't really know how to do much either... and it doesn't really help that Mod perms are messed up. No offense to him, but certainly not really a good staff member.\n\n\n6. Random. Wait, he's staff? I keep forgetting because he suffers a similar problem: doesn't really do staff things, and he's not even on the Discord server that often, much less the actual Minecraft server. Good guy: bad staff member.\n\n\n7. Leedle. Draws very well! Doesn't do staff very well. I don't think I've ever seen him do any staff tasks at all.\n\n\n8. Gaben/ShadowKnight/LolMech. A man who goes by many names. He seems to do some staff things, and is maybe... 2nd staff most active on the server after Orb? I haven't seen him do all that much staff stuff, though. \n\n\n9. Pluff. I've seen him do some staff stuff on Discord IIRC, but I haven't seen him on the minecraft server in a long time.\n\n\n**Part 4:** Expanding the server. Users who come don't stay. They're asked 'are you new?' by staff a few times, and then they leave, never to be seen again. The server is not welcoming to new players, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay.\n\n\n**Part 5:** 'Sexual' moments. This server has gone way too far with this. First were the fanfics. They were one thing and they certainly messed me up the first time I saw them, and that was a long time ago. I think these things have gone even more overboard, though. The fanfics were messed up for sure, but they weren't on too often, and they were certainly 100% just for comedy. However, a lot of these things are serious now. People asking for porn drawn, people talking about Ghire's Tits all the time, it's gone way overboard. And Spurr is also a large problem with this. The stories he makes up are even worse than the Fanfic Gen ever was. He goes super-overboard. I'm honestly getting sick of it-- and it's super weird. Like, these characters sorta represent the users on the server, and they're drawn fucking each other. You can NOT seriously think that that is not messed up.\n\n\n**Part 6:** There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I've been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can't really decide if I really could leave. It's sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was Admin for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Freddit time. Everything was active, things were good. and the drama hadn't really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don't know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don't see it coming back, so I don't really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now. \n\n\nThat's all I have to say for now.\n\n**Edit: I might also make a 'discord server post' about people who think that the Minecraft server portion is irrelevant**\n\n",

Now, I get it-- it's the most inactive time of the year, but the Discord is so much more active that it really feels like the server is truly dying.\n\nDefine dying? What happens when a server dies?The server is still active. A lot of the time activity on it is limited to like 2 players, but there are also big spikes in activity from time to time like when you and psy were unbanned, and I feel like most of those active on the discord are anyways burnt out on Minecraft for the most part ~~and to be fair the march 19th attack which deleted four months' worth of builds pretty much set back my motivation and probably that of others to actively play on the server oops~~\n\n&gt; Part 2: Deterioration of the server. Hovertal is gone for one, so that absolutely sucks. I missed that. The server is also completely piled with griefs. I'm serious. Just go to spawn, check it out! It's a gallery of griefs! There seems to be nothing new happening, either. I heard Sven was adding a roller coaster plugin: something he's just pulled from the shelf of Spigot, no doubt. Sounds really special, doesn't it? Instead of a cool plugin made just for us, it's just... there. Equal to any other plugin.\n\nReport griefs in #request-staff-help and staff rolls it back. It's how this usually rolls. I agree that less activities are happening on the server, but Sven is adding new stuff like coasterbuilder (which you mentioned). If I recall correctly it *is* something Sven is developing on his own, or at least with a guy he knows. If it were a simple off-the-shelf Spigot plugin Sven would've grabbed it back when he first promised coasterbuilder in like 2016.\n\n&gt; Part 3: Staff. [...]\n\nYou keep saying \"they don't do staff activities\", but what exactly do you mean by this? What should a staff member's ideal schedule be in your mind? Even with Zelda you say a staff-only activity he does doesn't count. Keep in mind that there's a staff chat where things are actively discussed - most of those you mentioned \"not doing much staff stuff\" actively contribute to these discussions behind the scenes.\n\n\n&gt; Part 4: Expanding the server. Users who come don't stay. They're asked 'are you new?' by staff a few times, and then they leave, never to be seen again. The server is not welcoming to new players, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay.\n\nHow can we improve this? Besides, there's not much we can do to attract new players. Some join and become active (floop for example), and the others just want to quickly check out the cool server they see on /r/fnaf's sidebar. I feel we welcome new players adequately, even with the questions (which are obligatory because of the whole alt situation).\n\n&gt; Part 5: 'Sexual' moments. This server has gone way too far with this. First were the fanfics. They were one thing and they certainly messed me up the first time I saw them, and that was a long time ago. I think these things have gone even more overboard, though. The fanfics were messed up for sure, but they weren't on too often, and they were certainly 100% just for comedy. However, a lot of these things are serious now. People asking for porn drawn, people talking about Ghire's Tits all the time, it's gone way overboard. And Spurr is also a large problem with this. The stories he makes up are even worse than the Fanfic Gen ever was. He goes super-overboard. I'm honestly getting sick of it-- and it's super weird. Like, these characters sorta represent the users on the server, and they're drawn fucking each other. You can NOT seriously think that that is not messed up.\n\nI kinda agree with this. But usually people are told to stop when needed (although sometimes it continues afterwards (~~guilty~~)). And about the last part - we're anyways teenagers and we gave each other consent to draw our characters pornographically. I just find drawings of an old man fucking a ghost funny.\n\n&gt; Part 6: There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I've been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can't really decide if I really could leave. It's sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was Admin for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Freddit time. Everything was active, things were good. and the drama hadn't really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don't know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don't see it coming back, so I don't really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now. That's all I have to say for now.\n\nY'know what they say about leaving Freddit, but godspeed to you. Let me know if I missed out on any points or if you'd like me to explain further.",

The removal of this post will only solidify that.\n\nSo here I am, Depend, ex-admin of Freddit Freebuild.\n\nLet's create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.\n\nContention 1: \"\"\"\"Staff\"\"\"\"\nBeing a staff member had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit's staff was just fluff. Head-Co-Mod[+] or whatever. Basically all of the staff roles were fucking useless until Manager where you would have finite permissions.\n\nMoving on from the fundamental flaws, the staff team itself has never been good.\n\nI've seen 2 good staff members. Random and Zen.\n\nJAFC - Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn't be allowed to run servers.\n\nZoo - A fucking lunatic with an ego bigger than thought to be possible.\n\nAxe - Literal figurehead. Pretty much a scapegoat but also shitty.\n\nSven - Jesus I don't even know where to begin, so I don't know if I can.\n\nPsy - One of the worst staff members I think I've seen anywhere. Imagine a big intimidating balloon, except it pops if you look at it weirdly.\n\nKeep in mind, these are or have been some of the top people in charge of the server. If I was talking about all staff, people like Steam would be filling up this post. Alas, I don't have the time for that.\n\nContention 2: Waving and Woger\nWoger - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.\n\nWaving - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for mgs.\n\nFor some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Waving) has been banned over some stupid grudges.\n\nAm i here to defend Waving and Woger? No they can eat dicks. Am I here for the staff then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely retarded. You created \"wars\", specifically comprised of downtime for regular players and fucking meaningless tension. All because you're fucking little kids who can't handle a situation like this with player convenience in mind.\n\nContention 3: Hip Memes\nShitposts were, are, and will always be rampant. Is this bad? Not necessarily. Until you consider that the fucking TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER are the honchos. Not trusted users. The fucking leaders flood the chat with their cancerous immature memes.\n\nYou know who likes reading the bee movie script? Fucking no one.\n\nThe fan-fictions, while they may be intentionally shittily written, were pushed as the face of Freddit's comedy. Were they funny? No. Not because they were edgy, but because they were so over the top. Make a pastiche of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Zoo's fanfics.\n\nContention 4: Companies\nthey're not real fuck off. i have over 200 screenshots of the inside of every company hq.\n\nFinal Contention: \"Guys let's fix things\"\nThe staff team is fucking incompetent. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\nThere's drama.\n\nWhy the fuck?\n\nNo, you fucking mouthbreather, it's not normal drama. Someone pulling the strings must have a stiffy for the drama because it's relentless and petty.\n\nAny time the staff tries to revise or reform things, they get shittier.\n\nSpawn is literally dogshit.\n\nReformed staff team is literally dogshit.\n\nThis was the final proof to me that the staff team, Sven and Zoo in particular, are far more incompetent than I thought a human being could be. They're so wallowed in their own ego-boners, that I'll actually be amazed if they let this post stay up.\n\nTo anyone who's read this, thank you.\n\nFreddit has gone from shit to fucking actual trash. I won't be coming back, and I urge you out there to move on to other things.\n\nFuck.\n\n~Depend\n\nPs: None of your \"\"\"comics\"\"\", \"\"\"shows\"\"\", or \"\"\"stories\"\"\" are interesting nor original in the slightest.",
