The removal of this post will negate that.\n\nSo here I am, Deep End, ex-co-head-admin[+] of Reddit Fweebuild.\n\nLet's create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.\n\n#Contention 1: \"\"\"\"Pineapple on Pizza\"\"\"\"\n\nPutting pineapple on pizza had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit's pizza topping combos were just fluff. Pepperoni-Co-Mushroom[+] or whatever. Basically all of the pizza toppings were fucking useless until bacon where you would have tasty flavors.\n\nMoving on from the flavor flaws, the toppings themselves have never been practical.\n\nI've seen 2 good topping combos. Chicken+Onion and Bacon+Mushroom.\n\nPineapple - Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn't be allowed to run pizza parlors.\n\nSausage - A fucking meat with a taste smaller than spurr's dick.\n\nPepperoni - Literal figurehead. Pretty much a poster boy topping but also shitty.\n\nBanana Peppers - Jesus I don't even know where to begin, so I don't know if I can.\n\nBlack Olives - One of the worst pizza topppings I think I've seen anywhere. Imagine a big tasty balloon, except it ruins a pizza if you look at it weirdly.\n\nKeep in mind, these are or have been some of the top selling toppings on pizzas. If I was talking about all toppings, things like anchovies would be filling up this post. Alas, I don't have the time for that.\n\n#Contention 2: Server Owners\n\nBolbi - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.\n\nWaluigi - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for your mom.\n\nFor some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Waluigi) has been banned over some stupid grudges. \n\nAm i here to defend Waluigi and Bolbi? No they can eat dicks. Am I here for the toppings then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely retarded. You created \"pizzas\", specifically comprised of soggy crust for regular customers and fucking meaningless sauce combos. All because you're fucking little kids who can't make pizzas in a situation like this with customer convenience in mind.\n\n#Contention 3: Hip Memes\n\nShitposts were, are, and will always be rampant. Is this bad? Not at all. They're made better by the fact that the TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER are the honchos. Even the most trusted users are envious. The leaders flood the chat with their hilarious and maturely refined memes.\n\nYou know who likes reading the bee movie script? Fucking everyone.\n\nThe fan-fictions, while they may be intentionally perfectly written, were pushed as the face of Freddit's comedy. Were they funny? Yes. Because they were edgy, and because they were so over the top. Make a fresh new spin of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Zoo's reborn fanfics.\n\n#Contention 4: Companies\n\nthey're real fuck off. i have over 200 good boy points from inside of TBC.\n\n#Final Contention: \"Guys let's fix things\"\n\nThe staff team is fucking competent. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\nThere's no drama.\n\nI'm glad as fuck!\n\nWhen there is drama, it's normal drama. Someone pulling the strings must not have a stiffy for the drama because it's few and far between.\n\nAny time the staff tries to revise or reform things, they get better.\n\nSpawn is literally god tier.\n\nReformed staff team is literally god tier.\n\nThis was the final proof to me that the staff team, Sven and Zoo in particular, are far more competent than I thought a human being could be. They're so free of ego bias, that I'll actually be amazed if they don't let this post stay up.\n\nTo anyone who's read this, thank you.\n\nFreddit has gone from good to to absolutely. I will be coming back every day from 09:00 to 23:00 EST, and I urge you out there to do the same.\n\nFuck yeah.\n\n~Depend\n\nPs: All of your comics, shows, and stories are interesting and original in every sense of the word.",
