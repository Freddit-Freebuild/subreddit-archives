I don't really know anyone besides you here, Yung.\n\n**Yung**: I'm flattered.\n\n**Chris**: There's a reason why you sympathize with someone like me. What is it?\n\n**Yung**: The Psychanic Project's team, my team, wasn't exactly... friendly to each other. We were brought together by Sven. He funded the project, he wanted to create robots that could wander around the server. Be personal assistants, build houses, serve food.\n\n**Yung**: The team wasn't all from Orbcorp. There was some from other companies and corporations, and some independent individuals. Some of them were just... odd. In the beggining the ambient was all but peaceful. Nobody knew each other, apart from me and Orb who worked in Orbcorp.\n\n**Yung**: Orb instructed everyone to write their ideas on how to do the project, and to start coding and then they could all compare. There was this one guy who wrote an entire script in one go. Like he had it memorized.\n\n**Chris**: Who was he?\n\n**Yung**: We called him \"Doctor Heinz\". We didn't even know his full name. He wrote a script, and Orb took a look at it. It seemed quite good, and was very organized. So, Heinz asked Orb to run the script. That's when things got weird. Instead of just running the script normally, Dr. Heinz wanted to rewrite it in the computer. Copy it by hand and type each character.\n\n**Yung**: Orb agreed and Dr. Heinz rewrote it. After he spent 10 minutes or so writing his own code again, he executed it and we waited. Nothing happened. Or so we thought. After a while, Orb immediatly shut down the computer. The program Dr. Heinz was running was trying to get out to Orbcorp's network and infect every single device nearby.\n\n**Chris**: It was a virus?\n\n**Yung**: More than that. It was a weapon. It was meant to pull every single information and data from Orbcorp's computer and then self-erase like it was never there.\n\n**Chris**: And? Did it work?\n\n**Yung**: No. Fortunatly for us, Orb was smarter than that. He let Dr. Heinz run his program inside a controlled enviroment, one which was completly dissassociated from the outside world. The virus never escaped from that laptop. Turns out Dr. Heinz was a spy for a rival company called Delos. He was arrested, and still is.\n\n**Chris**: But what does that have to do with you?\n\n**Yung**: The team moved on. We worked on the Psychanics as I told you yesterday, but we never managed to achieve the true artificial intelligence. A month later, Ballonz was created. Then I get a call from Sven himself, asking how the project was doing. I told him the truth, that Orb managed to create one. He procceeds to tell me to disband the team, and to retrieve a laptop from the facility.\n\n**Chris**: That's a very specific order.\n\n**Yung**: He told me that if I didn't do what he said, he would have sent his men to kill me. That's around the time when I realized Sven was up to no good. I retrieved the laptop that he wanted, but I took a look first before I handed it to him.\n\n**Yung**: It was a raw copy of Dr. Heinz' program. I was scared about what Sven could do with that ammount of power, so I edited it slightly. I wrote some code that made it output what the virus was doing to a safe place. Then I handed the laptop with the program to Sven.\n\n**Yung**: Almost immediatly, Nue and Ryan grab me, and throw me into a van. I figured out I was going to get killed by Sven to cover it up. I noticed that by my side there was a lady. She was dead, victim of an explosion. I'm thinking, I'm probably getting buried with her--\n\n**Chris**: The lady... Can you describe her?\n\n**Yung**: Brown hair, brown eyes. At least one. The other was destroyed by the explosion. I also think she was wearing like a crown of flowers, I don't know why.\n\n**Chris**: Oh my god...\n\n**Yung**: You knew her?\n\n**Chris**: She was a very special friend... Nue killed her in an attempt to kill me. Her name was Rose. I'm guessing he was cleaning up after himself.\n\n**Yung**: I heard Ryan and Nue fight over it. Nue admitted that he didn't kill you, that you had survived and escaped, but that he killed her. Ryan was really angry over it, because of the aftermath. I don't know what happened next, if it was because of them fighting or if someone got in the road, but we suffered a car crash.\n\n**Yung**: I woke up, and I ran as fast as I could. I met some guys that helped me cross the border and I arrived at Xeon.\n\n**Chris**: The laptop... Does it still output data?\n\n**Yung**: Yes. The program was almost totally rewritten, but my code is intact. The program was used in a facility called Mega's Lab. It was used to code a complex system that would activate some very terryfing stuff.\n\n**Chris**: What was it?\n\n**Yung**: Something they called \"the X-Nuke\". A nuclear bomb made out of multiple nuclear bombs inside, that could deploy each one in specific locations. They used Dr. Heinz' code as a failswitch. In case someone activated the X-Nuke, they would use the program to make it explode in the air or deploy them in a safe location.\n\n**Chris**: So whoever hacked that program had control of the X-Nuke?\n\n**Yung**: That's right.\n\n**Chris**: Can we revert the proccess?\n\n**Yung**: Chris... You want to hack the X-Nuke?\n\n**Chris**: And control it. You can use the data output to your computer and reverse engineer the way into the X-Nuke. We can get our revenge, Yung.\n\n**Yung**: Chris we'd be killing thousands of innocent people.\n\n**Chris**: We'd have a leverage. There's also someting I need to care of, and I need your help with it.\n\n**Yung**: What?\n\n**Chris**: I'm going to run for owner of Xeon. But I need full support.\n\n**Yung**: Chris you're NEVER going to win against Spulb.\n\n**Chris**: He has been owner of Xeon for a long, long time, it's true. But I have a plan. After I'm owner of Xeon, we will hack into X-Nuke and use it as leverage against Sven.\n\n**Yung**: What if Sven doesn't react? What if he doesn't respond to the demands?\n\n**Chris**: Then we'll launch them. Full power, full blast. We'll bring the fallout to Freddit.\n\n[!] THREAT IDENTIFIED\n\n[!] EVENT: Nuclear Devastation\n\n[!] TIME OF DETECTION: 00:00:00:07 after start-up.\n\n[!] TIME OF EVENT: Unknown\n\n[!] ACCURACY: 100%\n\n[!] RAIDER: plus_one_chris\n\n[!] Contacting ADMIN...\n\n[!] Contacting AUX_ADMIN...\n\n[!] VOICE RECOGNIZED: AUX_ADMIN\n\n[!] Text to speech function: \"Zoo?

In case someone activated the X-Nuke, they would use the program to make it explode in the air or deploy them in a safe location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: So whoever hacked that program had control of the X-Nuke?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Can we revert the proccess?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris... You want to hack the X-Nuke?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: And control it. You can use the data output to your computer and reverse engineer the way into the X-Nuke. We can get our revenge, Yung.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris we&amp;#39;d be killing thousands of innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;#39;d have a leverage. There&amp;#39;s also someting I need to care of, and I need your help with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m going to run for owner of Xeon. But I need full support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris you&amp;#39;re NEVER going to win against Spulb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: He has been owner of Xeon for a long, long time, it&amp;#39;s true. But I have a plan. After I&amp;#39;m owner of Xeon, we will hack into X-Nuke and use it as leverage against Sven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: What if Sven doesn&amp;#39;t react? What if he doesn&amp;#39;t respond to the demands?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Then we&amp;#39;ll launch them. Full power, full blast.
