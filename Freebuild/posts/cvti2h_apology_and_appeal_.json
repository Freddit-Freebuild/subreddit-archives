I regret these.  In the past, I tried to justify it by saying things like, \"this person did X first!\", but really it doesn't matter who starts it, but who ends it. Many times in the heat of the moment, I'd think I was right to keep arguing. I thought that I was right. But, recently, I realized that it didn't even matter if I was or not, as drama is drama and should be avoided anyway. It was foolish of me to continue arguing without thinking of what would happen. My carrying-on caused people stress and disrupted the general peace of the server, and I don't want to make that mistake again.  \n\n I have also learned how to distract myself from drama, and prevent it in the first place, by simply backing off and realizing that in times like that I'm only adding more fuel to the fire. I'm confident that I'll be able to avoid it as much as possible. Of course, the only way to fully prove this to you is by demonstrating it. That is why I request a trial unban, to prove that I've learned my lesson about stupid conflicts. There is no risk involved, as if I cause any drama, I'll be banned. I'm sorry for my previous actions, I regret them, and I promise that I will not reenact them.\n\n You may not trust and forgive me since after all, this is far from my first ban here, but that's okay. I hope to prove you otherwise, but I will just move on if that's the case. Apologies for any troubles I've caused in the past and thanks for all the memes. \n\n\\-Spurr",
