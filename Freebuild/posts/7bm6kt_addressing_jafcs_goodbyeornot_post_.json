I feel like there's some stuff he got wrong, and some valid points he brought up.\n\nThis is not at all a witch hunt or trying to start a flame war, JAFC's post was well put together with no inflamatory swings and it's his opinion and it's good and honest feedback, which me and the rest of the staff appreciate. But there's some stuff I feel like I need to address to explain or to correct, so that's why I'm making this post.\n\n---\n\n_Part 1: Inactivity. The server is completely inactive. The most users I see everyday are 2-3, and even that's becoming rarer. Now, I get it-- it's the most inactive time of the year, but the Discord is so much more active that it really feels like the server is truly dying._\n\nAlmost everyone on the server agree Freddit is a discord community with a Minecraft server. Not the other way around. The discord is active, with some slow periods during the day due to timezones + school. People usually come together on the server to do a particular thing - RP, filming, building a project together.\n\nThis means if you want to check up on Freddit, you don't join the Minecraft server, you just pop in discord. This explains why the MC server's activity goes down as the discord activity goes up. We are, afterall, a community. A chat reserved for us to talk and interact is perfect.\n\n---\n\n_Part 2: Deterioration of the server. Hovertal is gone for one, so that absolutely sucks. I missed that._\n\nPeople complained about Hovertal because nobody used it anymore. It just spammed the chat and it became useless. If people want it back, I'll add it, but I too felt like it was dead weight - same as marriage.\n\n---\n\n_The server is also completely piled with griefs. I'm serious. Just go to spawn, check it out! It's a gallery of griefs! There seems to be nothing new happening, either._\n\nPeople are welcome and encouraged to report griefs to #request-staff-help. If nobody complains, sometimes it's hard to fix things you think are fine. We rollback any and all griefs people tell us that have happened, and unless we happened to forgot, that's what's happened and will happen.\n\n---\n\n_I heard Sven was adding a roller coaster plugin: something he's just pulled from the shelf of Spigot, no doubt. Sounds really special, doesn't it? Instead of a cool plugin made just for us, it's just... there. Equal to any other plugin._\n\nSven says he's been coding it with a friend. It's always been his project and that is where the \"WHERE'S COASTER BUILDER\" meme came from. Sven has always worked on it and never finished it, no doubt a lot of times not working on it.\n\nBut this has happened since your time and Chris' time. Sven announcing projects that don't come or turn up not to be the same as he advertised. Everyone knows this, and yes it is a valid point, it's not a product of the \"new freddit\".\n\n---\n\n_Zoo. I'd consider Zoo the 'community owner'. That is NOT a bad thing. He monitors the community and deals with most drama situations. This is all fine, but... He's letting the server deteriorate. He's not focusing on it. He's also not all that active in my experience, but I might just think that due to our timezones._\n\nDuring these past weeks, I've been invisible on Discord. I used never to do that, which is a part of the reason why you probably think I'm not there when I am.\n\nI played on the MC server yesterday and on sunday  with some people. I won't lie saying I'm not as active as I was during summer, I'm definetly more inactive and you are right when you say I'm not that active.\n\nI've expressed these things in a rant a week ago in #venting where I even went to the point of offering my resignation if people felt like I should be demoted and I shouldn't be trusted with owner anymore. Most people said I should be kept as owner even if I am not as active anymore.\n\nYou did say that it could be due to our timezone differences, and yes that's another factor, along with the \"always invisible\" and \"im more inactive than i used to be due to school work\". However, I don't feel like I'm letting the server \"deteriorate\".\n\nPlugins don't cultivate interest as much as they used to. They don't have the player boost effect you think they do, because it's a fact that people on Freddit don't play MC Freddit that much anymore. But as I said, your point is valid and although there's reasons why the server feels more deteriorated, there's room for improvement and I will be on the look out for fun plugins.\n\nSven launched a feedback poll to get the sense of some new stuff coming up and people's reactions. We've discussed this, including the new rank, a proposed rank reset by Sven and other things.\n\n---\n\n_... He also seems to be restricted from doing anything else-- if he makes a community decision, all of staff backlash instantly._\n\n(About sven); This part was weird. Sven's new additions that get removed are the ones the community doesn't like. The backlash you talk about is true, a lot of backlash happens when sven suggested, for example:\n\nResetting everyone's ranks, unbanning Waving on Minecraft for no reason other than he's been waiting for too long, giving an idea that ranks should be pay-to-get, and also faking some \"emergencies\" and \"threats\" for the giggles.\n\nHe also suggests a lot of cool shit, like coasterbuilder, survival, other really fun stuff he has brainstormed with us. And we've liked it. There's stuff people like, and stuff people don't like.\n\nI don't think it's fair to exempt Sven from criticism and to say he should be able to add anything he pleases because he has a userbase to look out for, and Sven understands this, for the most part.\n\nWhen people disagree with his additions, most of the time he gives up on them. That takes dedication to this community. Yes sometimes he still goes through it and then cancells it after the backlash, but at least he listens to the criticism and embraces it.\n\nThis is one of the points you made I think shouldn't be accounted for. My and Sven's decisions should be questioned by the community. This is not a dictatorship where we do whatever we please, our additions are to contribute to the server, if they do the opposite, they should be shut down, whether it's mine or sven's idea.\n\n---\n\nAnd then this segment, which is a bit sad how you've claimed no staff at all do their jobs right. This is just blatantly false. Your exposure to their work is reduced significantly so I don't blame you for thinking it, afterall you were used to seeing them work in #staff.\n\nWe discuss and talk and suggest shit in #staff. The product of the MC server not being as active results in Staff not being as active in MC. It's cause and effect. This doesn't mean they're not serving the community well.\n\nI've seen staff members more active than anyone. Only Leaf, Zach and some other regulars level their activity on the discord. On public discord? No, some of the staff aren't as active. On #staff? They're as active and some are more active than the rest of the people.\n\n---\n\n_Part 4: Expanding the server. Users who come don't stay. They're asked 'are you new?' by staff a few times, and then they leave, never to be seen again. The server is not welcoming to new players, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay._\n\nBarely anyone cares about FNAF compared to how people cared about it. [This is google trend search for \"fnaf\".](https://imgur.com/Dc6QAwL).\n\nIt's been decreasing ever since. This is why players dont come as often as they used to. Why join the FNAF MC server when FNAF is barely relevant? Which is another reason why Freddit isn't focused to FNAF that much anymore.\n\n_Part 5: 'Sexual' moments._\n\nAgreed on most part. I think we should enforce and constrain this more. Yesterday a poll was made to dictate Spurr's second ban for this offense. We know about this and we are working on it.\n\n---\n\n_Part 6: There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I've been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can't really decide if I really could leave. It's sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was Admin for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Freddit time. Everything was active, things were good. and the drama hadn't really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don't know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don't see it coming back, so I don't really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now._\n\nThis is up to you. If you think Freddit isn't as exciting anymore, that's totally fine and you're welcome to leave. You're a great dude who did some stupid shit in the past. I'll miss you and most of your shitposts and memes. Yes I said most don't go spam me with yee haw pleas\n\n---\n\nAnyways, response over. \n\n**tldr mc server isnt as active due to decrease in interest in minecraft and fnaf, which leads to less new players and to more activity on discord instead of mc, which leads to staff working more on discord (#staff) instead of mc leading to people not seeing their work**\n\n&lt;/response&gt;",

I don&amp;#39;t see it coming back, so I don&amp;#39;t really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is up to you. If you think Freddit isn&amp;#39;t as exciting anymore, that&amp;#39;s totally fine and you&amp;#39;re welcome to leave. You&amp;#39;re a great dude who did some stupid shit in the past. I&amp;#39;ll miss you and most of your shitposts and memes. Yes I said most don&amp;#39;t go spam me with yee haw pleas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, response over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr mc server isnt as active due to decrease in interest in minecraft and fnaf, which leads to less new players and to more activity on discord instead of mc, which leads to staff working more on discord (#staff) instead of mc leading to people not seeing their work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
