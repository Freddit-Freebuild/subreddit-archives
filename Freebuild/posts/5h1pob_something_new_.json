By their side there's a desk with some paperwork and a painting above it. There is no natural light and it's underground.)_\n\n**Dr. Orb**: Bring yourself back online, Mirai.\n\n**Mirai**: Hello.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: You've never read TFOF, have you, Mirai?\n\n**Mirai**: TFOF?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: It's a series made by a Freddittor called Zoo. TFOF means The Fallout of Freddit. The story bases on Freddittors surviving through a nuclear holocaust.\n\n**Mirai**: Dark.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: Indeed. People always had took TFOF as an exageration of our reality. There was no way we would get to that point.\n\n**Mirai**: Your phrasing suggests you did get to that point. Am I wrong?\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(smiling)_: A perfect student of human nature. But I'm afraid not even Zoo could have the vision for such a timeline.\n\n**Mirai**: So it didn't happen? It was indeed an exageration of our reality. Why did you bring it up?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: I should've phrased better. We took it as a negative exageration of our future. A dark and terrible vision that we would not sink to. I'm afraid we were wrong. TFOF wasn't a negative exageration of what our timeline could be.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: It was a brighter, happier exageration.\n\n**Mirai**: Surely a nuclear holocaust is worst than whatever our world has gone through.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: You don't know what we've been through.\n\n**Mirai**: What happened? What went wrong?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: It begins in a time of war... With a villain named Barclay Leetham. You see, when Barclay was around there was a lot of tension between the ex-owner and the owner who took his place. The reason for that is the ex-owner, Shiner Crow, had assassinated a friend of the owner.\n\n**Mirai**: Why would he do that?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: Mr. Crow had lost a very good friend of his... And the only reason that happened was because of the owner's friend. Dennard. He ordered the attack.\n\n**Mirai**: What a weird name.\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(smiles and looks down)_: Heh. _(looks at Mirai)_ You think the name Dennard is weird?\n\n**Mirai**: Yeah. It's like they wanted to write Bernard and Dennis and just glued them together and tada.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: His last name was Petties. Even weirder, I suppose.\n\n**Mirai**: Holy crap. My bet is that whoever the ex-owner was, he killed Dennard because of his name.\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(smiling)_: I'm afraid it's a bit more... complicated than that.\n\n**Mirai**: Seems personal?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: I'm old, but not that old, Mirai.\n\n**Mirai**: It was a long time ago?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: Yes. After Crow had killed Dennard, the owner sent teams of people to search for him. He was trying to escape from the server, but he was found by Barclay. Barclay ordered Shiner to be on his knees, he put his gun to Crow's head, and pulled the trigger. And so the death of Shiner Crow happens.\n\n**Mirai** _(confused)_: How is Barclay the villain here? I mean sure he killed Shiner, but Shiner had killed Dennard like you said.\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(gets up from his chair)_: Without context, he wouldn't be such a villain, I suppose. But his action lead to a series of... unfortunate events. _(looks at painting)_\n\n**Mirai** _(gets up from his chair)_: Orb. Did you lie to me?\n\n**Dr. Orb**: When?\n\n**Mirai**: The way you describe the events... They're way too personal.\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(looking at Mirai)_: Mirai, Barclay happened in 2015.\n\n**Mirai** _(stunned)_: 2015?!\n\n**Dr. Orb**: That's right. _(looks at painting)_ I'm not that old, as I told you. The events that happened because of Shiner Crow's death by Barclay... They were a lot different from the TFOF alternative universe. And I would say much... worse.\n\n**Mirai**: And what is TFOF's alternative universe?\n\n**Dr. Orb** _(looking down)_: Crow survives the encounter with Barclay. Ends up in a nuclear holocaust, but at least they had vaults where they could go and hide. In our world... _(hesitates)_ In our world we didn't have that sense of... safety.\n\n**Mirai**: That's one humdinger of a story about your world, Orb.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: About my world? _(laughs)_ I think you got this one wrong, Mirai. That was the story about your world, not mine. _(picks up a paper with a drawn symbol on it)_\n\n**Mirai** _(confused)_: My world? I don't have a world.\n\n**Dr. Orb**: You will, soon. But I'm glad you liked the story about your new home. _(shows the paper to Mirai)_ I do believe that the best stories are always the ones rooted in truth. And the simularities between your world and mine will be... (_looks at the papers)_ very uncanny.\n\n**Mirai** _(shocked)_: No... No! Orb, please! Don't put me there! I've read your plans!\n\n**Dr. Orb**: Don't get yourself worked up. _(stores papers away)_ Perhaps it's best if you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber. _(Mirai freezes)_\n\n**Dr. Orb**: _(puts his hand on Mirai's shoulder)_ For now. _(pats on Mirai's shoulder twice and starts walking slowly accross the room)_ I have to go now. I need to start working on your friends. After all... _(looks at old picture on the wall)_ Loneliness can be quite a depressing... state. _(smiles and approaches an endoskeleton)_ Goodbye, for now.\n\n_(Dr. Orb looks at the old endoskeleton that has a post-it glued to his left arm saying \"Let's do this - Cherry\", gains a sad expression, and then walks out of the room)_\n\n---\n\nDream World prologue part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/Freebuild/comments/5hh5g9/dream_world_prologue_part_1/",
