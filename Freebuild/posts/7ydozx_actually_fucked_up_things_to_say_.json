[you sure didn't.](https://imgur.com/a/6M94X) \"oh so why don't you include the logs of you saying that\" I was banned from the discord with the logs in it! (nido told me I was just banned, and it wasn't deleted) you did include me saying it about leedle though, so at least that's something.\n\n\n\nand yes, i did apologize for telling people to 'fuck off.', but I thought I said 'fuck you people', but that doesn't really matter (unless you're talking about some other fuck off I don't remember?) i remember apologizing for saying 'fuck you people', so if you're talking about me saying that, you're just plain lying about me not apologizing.\n\n\nalso, i meant that leedle was mostly accepted because of that. if leedle joined Freddit, and didn't draw porn, or even better-- didn't draw at all, do you still think people would treat him the way they do? even if he drew-- but not porn, they still wouldn't treat him how they do now. \n\n\n\nand-- where was I bashing Nido? i wasn't intending to bash Nido-- I was talking about how I feel like Freddit has been towards people-- I wasn't trying to attack Nido at all. but if you want to bring that up, why not bring up [this](https://imgur.com/a/ayocF)? this shit really hurt and offended me-- does it deserve to be brought up? and this IS from a staff member, too, which just makes it worse in my opinion. and I wasn't telling her TO draw porn, i was saying if she did I really believe people would like her better. that's my opinion. i don't WANT her to do it though-- i never said I did.\n\n\nand-- i stated Nido was a good person on multiple occasions! Did you forget that? it was my main point during the nintendo argument-- that he shouldn't be treated better just because he's young, because Nido could be mature most of the time! that was literally my main argument against that. so stop saying I was undermining Nido, because it's simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(nido told me I was just banned, and it wasn&amp;#39;t deleted) you did include me saying it about leedle though, so at least that&amp;#39;s something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and yes, i did apologize for telling people to &amp;#39;fuck off.&amp;#39;, but I thought I said &amp;#39;fuck you people&amp;#39;, but that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter (unless you&amp;#39;re talking about some other fuck off I don&amp;#39;t remember?) i remember apologizing for saying &amp;#39;fuck you people&amp;#39;, so if you&amp;#39;re talking about me saying that, you&amp;#39;re just plain lying about me not apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also, i meant that leedle was mostly accepted because of that. if leedle joined Freddit, and didn&amp;#39;t draw porn, or even better-- didn&amp;#39;t draw at all, do you still think people would treat him the way they do? even if he drew-- but not porn, they still wouldn&amp;#39;t treat him how they do now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and-- where was I bashing Nido? i wasn&amp;#39;t intending to bash Nido-- I was talking about how I feel like Freddit has been towards people-- I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to attack Nido at all. but if you want to bring that up, why not bring up &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ayocF\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? this shit really hurt and offended me-- does it deserve to be brought up? and this IS from a staff member, too, which just makes it worse in my opinion. and I wasn&amp;#39;t telling her TO draw porn, i was saying if she did I really believe people would like her better. that&amp;#39;s my opinion. i don&amp;#39;t WANT her to do it though-- i never said I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and-- i stated Nido was a good person on multiple occasions! Did you forget that? it was my main point during the nintendo argument-- that he shouldn&amp;#39;t be treated better just because he&amp;#39;s young, because Nido could be mature most of the time! that was literally my main argument against that. so stop saying I was undermining Nido, because it&amp;#39;s simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
