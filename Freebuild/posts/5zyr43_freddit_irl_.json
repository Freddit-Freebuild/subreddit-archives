This is supposed to be a extra activity to your life, like, enjoying some times with friends and community and shit.\n\nLike, the rules are here to keep things from derailing. When I see JAFC, for example, changing the subreddit banner to Yeah Boy and then not giving up membership of the sub , of course those things aren't in the rules, _specifically_. But the common sense rule and the dont start drama and shit are here for those situations.\n\nSeriously, doing something stupid and then claiming \"it isn't against the rules\" is one of the lowest blows you can do. It's like you want things to become more strict - and I'm no longer talking to JAFC, by the way, he hasnt done anything outrageous against the rules since his unban - why? It's supposed to be the comic relief, or just relief, like a place to hang out and check out cool builds, for example, even build a few, talk with people and shit.\n\nAnd that's another reason why some permanent bans are permanent bans - to keep it like that. We don't want fucking months of someone trying to take over because their ego is too big to suck up that they weren't managing the server good.\n\nWhen you resigned, Pig, for example, I was totally cool with it. You didn't want to be staff, so it's totally fine, like, I didn't start questioning you \"WHY DID YOU LEAVE???\" because staff are like the guys who try to keep things in order, nothing else. They aren't the fucking FBI or anything.\n\nThe bottom line is, this is no high superior call nor it is some elevated state of existence. Don't stress shit out or obsess over things on Freddit (btw this comment kinda doesnt correspond 100% to what you said, Pig, and these things arent directed towards you, so dont get the idea im saying youre obsessing over the shitposts - I'm not)\n\nAlso shitposting a shitpost is stupid and doesn't have the same effect as the shitpost. I think that's one of your points in your post, and I agree.\n\nAlso, don't become the shitpost. ",
