Spurr and I have gone into misfits multiple times, but I know for a **fact** that he doesn't deserve to be permanent banned from this community.\n\nStaff and users sometimes are a bit harsh on him. It's plain true. If you _poke_ a bear with a _stick_, he will fight back (double pun for the effect) and Spurr most definetly will fight back.\n\nThe way to deal with Spurr isn't just ban him or jail him, it's to try and talk to him instead of responding to the fire. Instead of the all \"spurr shut up\" or some shits like that, actually try to explain him calmly whatever the hell is going on. Of course if he doesn't follow after that, a punishment will do. But not a freaking permanent ban, that's taking away all his builds and all his friends (yes he has friends not everybody hates him with their guts).\n\nI think if we can forgive some people we should be able to forgive Spurr, and start being a little more comprehensive with his situation. And of course, Spurr starting being less salty at times.\n\nI think the answer is not permanent ban him and exclude him from the community, but rather embrace him as a community member instead of that \"salty fuck boy\", I mean a LOT of times people say certain things to him without him provoking them, even if it's just \"creating a company that's better than SpurrCo\" could be offensive and could drive him to salt point.\n\nInstead of permanent-ban let's work together to try and accomplish a community that instead of trying to fix something it throws it away because it's more convenient. Spurr has been with the server for a long time, he shouldn't be kicked out because he freaks out about things. A LOT of times he freaks out on things that we cause, and if we took it as trying to explain to a community member what's going on rather than explaining to a salty fuck boy and with smart comebacks and flamewars maybe it'd be better for everyone.\n\nI just think banning him forever from this is really harsh, even for Spurr - tempban I can kinda dig it, but permanent ban? Can you imagine being excluded from Freddit forever? Seeing all those users and friends online on the multiplayer list but trying to join and \"The Ban Hammer has spoken!\"? Spurr doesn't deserve such a treatment, perma banning him is putting him along with all the major griefers and DDoSers and those who try to harm the server specifically, and Spurr is sure as hell not one of them.\n\nIf people leave him alone without saying stupid shit like \"oh boy here comes spurr\" and other shit like that, I'm 100% sure Spurr wouldn't be so salty. So, although he's part of the problem, we are too, and by banning him doesn't fix the broken pipe, it just throws the broken pipe away. And if we do this to all users we'll run out of canalization and how will we be able to poop you guys, we can try to fix the pipe. So, let's start working together to build a better community that doesn't perma-ban users for some incidents, perma ban is _really_ fucking long, it's forever, he wouldnt ever join again. That is just for the lowest of the lowest of users, and Spurr definetly is not. If we all stopped doing shits like the \"oh boy\" or \"here comes spurr\" or \"there we go again\" \"spurr shut up\" and all those things, it'd be better for all of us.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope you really consider what you're doing if you're perma-banning him.",

Instead of the all &amp;quot;spurr shut up&amp;quot; or some shits like that, actually try to explain him calmly whatever the hell is going on. Of course if he doesn&amp;#39;t follow after that, a punishment will do. But not a freaking permanent ban, that&amp;#39;s taking away all his builds and all his friends (yes he has friends not everybody hates him with their guts).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think if we can forgive some people we should be able to forgive Spurr, and start being a little more comprehensive with his situation. And of course, Spurr starting being less salty at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is not permanent ban him and exclude him from the community, but rather embrace him as a community member instead of that &amp;quot;salty fuck boy&amp;quot;, I mean a LOT of times people say certain things to him without him provoking them, even if it&amp;#39;s just &amp;quot;creating a company that&amp;#39;s better than SpurrCo&amp;quot; could be offensive and could drive him to salt point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of permanent-ban let&amp;#39;s work together to try and accomplish a community that instead of trying to fix something it throws it away because it&amp;#39;s more convenient. Spurr has been with the server for a long time, he shouldn&amp;#39;t be kicked out because he freaks out about things. A LOT of times he freaks out on things that we cause, and if we took it as trying to explain to a community member what&amp;#39;s going on rather than explaining to a salty fuck boy and with smart comebacks and flamewars maybe it&amp;#39;d be better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just think banning him forever from this is really harsh, even for Spurr - tempban I can kinda dig it, but permanent ban? Can you imagine being excluded from Freddit forever? Seeing all those users and friends online on the multiplayer list but trying to join and &amp;quot;The Ban Hammer has spoken!&amp;quot;? Spurr doesn&amp;#39;t deserve such a treatment, perma banning him is putting him along with all the major griefers and DDoSers and those who try to harm the server specifically, and Spurr is sure as hell not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people leave him alone without saying stupid shit like &amp;quot;oh boy here comes spurr&amp;quot; and other shit like that, I&amp;#39;m 100% sure Spurr wouldn&amp;#39;t be so salty. So, although he&amp;#39;s part of the problem, we are too, and by banning him doesn&amp;#39;t fix the broken pipe, it just throws the broken pipe away. And if we do this to all users we&amp;#39;ll run out of canalization and how will we be able to poop you guys, we can try to fix the pipe. So, let&amp;#39;s start working together to build a better community that doesn&amp;#39;t perma-ban users for some incidents, perma ban is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fucking long, it&amp;#39;s forever, he wouldnt ever join again. That is just for the lowest of the lowest of users, and Spurr definetly is not. If we all stopped doing shits like the &amp;quot;oh boy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;here comes spurr&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;there we go again&amp;quot; &amp;quot;spurr shut up&amp;quot; and all those things, it&amp;#39;d be better for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, I hope you really consider what you&amp;#39;re doing if you&amp;#39;re perma-banning him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
