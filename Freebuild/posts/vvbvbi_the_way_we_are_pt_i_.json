But another you, also named...\n\nAdrian pauses and looks at the person's profile for a second.\n\n-- \"Villain McBadmann\" - right, of course - another McBadmann *is* a bad guy. Very bad guy. More precisely, in another Universe you decide to destroy the entire world with a meteor. You even end up thirsting to get other Universes as well.\n\nMcBadmann looks puzzled at Adrian, who's wearing a lab coat with [this symbol](https://i.imgur.com/xmFRbGg.png), and underneath, a name tag that reads \"Adrian Evanna, NLI Monitoring Division\".\n\nAdrian continues writing in her clipboard.\n\n-- Um... you said... a meteor? Am I like a god in that Universe?\n\n-- Nope. More precisely, you turn an entire city into a meteor and attempt to destroy the world. Something about evolution. Human kind not being perfect. Typical villain stuff. No pun intended, by the way. The Initiative would probably fire me if I joked about your name, seeing how you're like, comparable to Hitler or something. I don't know. Not clear on the rules.\n\n-- I... I don't understand.\n\n-- Right, right. You dig out an entire city, lift it up into the sky using rocket propellers and then let it drop to the earth. I know, not exactly a subtle way to make a meteor, but then again your name *is* Villain McBadmann. Subtlety ain't exactly your strong suit, eh?\n\nMcBadmann isn't amused.\n\n-- Shit. I made a joke about your name. Oh well.\n\n-- So let me get this straight, I'm going to do all that in this world? In the future?\n\n-- Oh no, no. You *were* going to do that. But seeing how last week's car accident is a big enough change in your life, your whole complex about becoming a superior being and whatnot doesn't really happen, according to our projections about your life.\n\nAdrian continues writing on her clipboard.\n\n-- You've predicted my life.\n\n-- Of course. Well, not me. The Supercomputer we have in our laboratories. Our actual boss at the Initiative gets the info from him and we just act accordingly. Technically the AI is our boss more than our actual boss. Regardless, our supreme robot overlord CaSE has stated you are no longer a threat. Hooray for the billions of innocent people, right?\n\n-- But why? What does it know about me?\n\n-- It predicted you're not going to be able to walk ever again, so the whole plan about making humans evolve and superior genetics and whatnot won't really make any sense to ya, seeing as you'd technically be inferior. I mean, it does say you're going to have some quite rageful feelings at first, but that you'll slowly adapt to your new life, come to peace with it, yadda yadda. The whole hedonic treadmill bullschnazzle, as the Human Behavior people back home call it. Makes you come to peace with humanity's flaws and whatnot, so you're clear of being a potential threat. Good job, you're not a shitty human being.\n\nAdrian hears no response. She spies McBadmann out of the upper corner of her glasses while pretending to write. After a long second, he replies.\n\n-- I... I won't be able to walk again?\n\nAdrian's face goes blank. She stops writing, unable to meet his stare.\n\n-- I'm sorry. I... It's just a prediction. But your life will be so much happier according to the projections. Being a genocidal villain isn't exactly good on your mental health. All things considered, it is good news.\n\n-- Good news?! You just told me it's hopeless to think I'll ever walk again! How the fuck am I supposed to come to terms with that?!\n\n-- I'm... I'm really sorry, McBadmann. With physical therapy, you may be able to take small steps. I just... Just have some faith in the prediction. You aren't going to become an evil tyrant. But think about it for a second! You *are* being resentful about your legs, just as the Supercomputer predicted!\n\n-- What?! Fuck no, I'm not mad at losing my legs!\n\nAdrian looks from the clipboard directly at McBadmann in confused silence.\n\n-- I couldn't give a shit about my legs. My father lived his life in a wheelchair, and he was the happiest man I knew. It's horrible, but it is what it is. I have to accept and live with that. So no. I'm not mad at that. I'm fucking pissed at *you*, Adrian. For telling *me* that. For taking the possibility of trying away from me. For snuffing away my hope to fight before I could even try. I don't care if the end result was always going to be losing. You took that away from me. The only anger I'm feeling is for you. You and your fucking lab computer.\n\nAdrian goes pale. The two share a watery stare at each other in silence.\n\n-- I...\n\n-- Don't say anything. *sigh*. Just get the fuck out of here. I need to rest.\n\n-- I'm sorry.\n\nNo reply. She looks away and triggers her Cock-Boy to teleport her back to the office.\n\n---",
