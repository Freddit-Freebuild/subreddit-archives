Monday\u2019s plunge followed remarks by Reversal City mayor Psy Pines, who broke with Freddit prime minister Sven Sonic and said that he would support a referendum to break from the Fredditan Union.\nAlready nervous over a so-called \u201cRevexit,\u201d investors are selling sterling at a rapid pace, which has fallen against every major currency.\n\nFixed exchange markets had calmed down at the end of last week after Sven announced an agreement with Freddit officials for the Freddit to stay in the 28-nation bloc ahead of the June 23rd election. The call to leave the political union comes as Sven's opponents say Freddit membership is not worth the financial cost, brings in too many migrants and is entangled with red tape.\n\nWhat\u2019s it to Reversalers?\n\nWe live in an increasingly global world and the specter of a Revexit will likely harm international growth, as well as parts of your foreign holdings.\n\n\u201cIf the electorate choose the \u2018leave\u2019 option, this may place a drag on both the Freddit economy and stock market,\u201d notes T.B.C.

Economics Zoo Canadanda told /r/freebuild.\n\nAs the Freddit battles high unemployment and low growth, this kind of shock will only add to investor anxiety.
