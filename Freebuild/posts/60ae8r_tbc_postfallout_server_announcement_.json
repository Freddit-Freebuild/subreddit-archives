But don't fear, fellow Freddittors, T.B.C. is here to guide you through this Post-Fallout Server!\n\nAs you may know, JAFC has, with the aid of Psy, and possibly manipulated by Waving, deleted a few worlds. This means they've been permanently erased from Freddit.\n\nA lot of builds have been lost. And most people are probably wondering why would JAFC do such a thing.\n\n**JAFC had lost OP**, for causing a bunch of drama on the discord. After that, he kept on pushing and kept being salty due to that fact, so he got tempbanned for a day.\n\nBut that's not the end of the story! Before he got tempbanned for a day, some users were disrespecting him and calling him names. **T.B.C. does not accept these actions and has made an official post on #news of the Discord, even before the takeovers happened**. But JAFC apparently snapped, and with Waving pushing him towards doing things for his own bidding, JAFC asked Psy to get unbanned.\n\nAfter being unbanned by Psy, he started deleting worlds. A bunch of people's works, including innocent people, got erased permanently. Countless people that had shitty lives outside of Freddit, some real SHIT that has happened to them, and they came on Freddit as a safe place from all their shit, to build and make friends. \n\nAll that gone. We joke about this being just legos, and it is legos, but it's still a place where people hide from their problems in their lives, and all that just got smashed for... For some insults by some people, everyone got their works deleted, but only a small fraction of those ever did anything to JAFC.\n\nAnyways, Psy &amp; JAFC are both permanent banned. We have suspicions that JAFC got manipulated by Waving.\n\n---\n\n#But fear not!\n\nThe engineers and masterminds at T.B.C. have come up with one humdinger of a plan! Besides permanently banning JAFC, Psy, and Waving, with no chance of appeal (maaaybe for Psy, but that's stretching), that is!\n\nThe plan, codename being **DEFCON -1**, is being put into place as I write this post. The Broccoli Company will ensure that Freddit will prevail, and we are doing our best efforts to get back what is ours, the worlds and the files!\n\n**Warning**: We are not responsible for any actions of an independent person might do. If person X decides to come to Waving/JAFC's house and murder them, T.B.C. &amp; it's global CEO are not responsible for his actions.\n\nOur plan is just talking with them to get back our files. Anything else someone else does is not of our own responsibility.\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, that's a wrap up! Thank you  for reading this T.B.C. Post-Fallout Server Announcement, and we hope Freddit will succeed and finally have it's peace, away from RR!
