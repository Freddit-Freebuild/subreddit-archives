I just don't feel like I've been doing this job enough justice as of late.\nMy internet has been getting progressively worse and worse. And with it, Reducing my ability to come on to this place and check up on it.\nIt's hard to explain but I honestly feel like I SHOULD be able to do better, Just, Can't.

It's about disapointment in myself, And how I feel like I've disapointed this community.\nI'll be responding to any further questions in the comments of this thread but for now.
