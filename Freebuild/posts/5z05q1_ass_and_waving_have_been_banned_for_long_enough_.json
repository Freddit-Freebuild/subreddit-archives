Unbanning them, putting all the shit aside, a new fresh start, exactly as you are suggesting today.\n\nWhat did Waving do? 5 minutes after being unbanned, he removed everyone's staff and op, made himself owner, took over, and said he was \"going to be a better owner\".\n\nWoger fakingly said \"It worked we took over\" and Waving thinking it was all Woger's plan opped him and ownered him.\n\nFrom there Woger removed Waving's staff and op and shit and I ipbanned him.\n\nSince that day, Woger hasn't done anything even CLOSE to a perma ban.\n\nSo yeah, woger and waving DID have the same chance, but Waving, unfortunatly, blew it.

Unbanning them, putting all the shit aside, a new fresh start, exactly as you are suggesting today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did Waving do? 5 minutes after being unbanned, he removed everyone&amp;#39;s staff and op, made himself owner, took over, and said he was &amp;quot;going to be a better owner&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woger fakingly said &amp;quot;It worked we took over&amp;quot; and Waving thinking it was all Woger&amp;#39;s plan opped him and ownered him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there Woger removed Waving&amp;#39;s staff and op and shit and I ipbanned him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since that day, Woger hasn&amp;#39;t done anything even CLOSE to a perma ban.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, woger and waving DID have the same chance, but Waving, unfortunatly, blew it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
