Yung recognizes Chris right away, and he tells Chris he used to live on Freddit as well.\n\n-Yung tells Chris that he used to work on Orbcorp. His main project was on artificial intelligence, and he began working on humanoid robots. He was part of a team that was developing what they called \"Psychanics\", robots that looked like humans, behaved like humans but had very distinct features.\n\n-Each member of the team worked on different Psychanics.\n\n[!] Accessing XEON's NSS...\n\n[!] Searching archived feeds...\n\n[!] Conversation located: MULTIPLE DEVICES AVAILABLE\n\n[!] Accessing \"Belinea #3482 v1.01.2\": COMPUTER MICROPHONE\n\n[!] Removing irrelevant noise...\n\n[!] Isolating conversation...\n\n[!] Speech to text function activated.\n\n**Yung**: We all could implement little special features on them. Make them invulnerable to fire, make them fly, make them not feel anything... Heck, Orb managed to make one which could regenerate his own skin. But we couldn't achieve the ultimate goal.\n\n**Chris**: Which was?\n\n**Yung**: True consciousness.\n\n**Chris**: So the project failed.\n\n**Yung**: Not at all. I don't think I have ever seen such a brilliant mind like Orb, but it wasn't perfect. The team split up. The Psychanic's core codes were erased but we kept the bodies. People went their own way but I stayed at Orbcorp.\n\n**Yung**:Until one day, me and Orb were playing chess after lunch, and I told him right before I won that game, \"For all your brilliance, Orb, your mind is still flawed. Check mate\". His face after that...\n\n**Chris**: He got offended?\n\n**Yung**: Quite the contrary. He looked at me with the most hopeful face I have ever seen and he stood up and ran to our offices.\n\n**Yung**: One month later he called the team again. We arrived at the old office and we saw a guy that we have never seen before. We wondered if it was a new employee, and we asked him where Orb was.\n\n**Yung**: He said he was about to arrive. And then we chatted for a while. He was very nice to us, and we shared stories, told jokes. There was a point in that afternoon where he asked me a riddle, and I couldn't solve it. Never heard it. To reply to him, I told him a riddle and to my surprise he got the correct answer almost immediatly.\n\n**Chris**: Most of them are tough. Did he know that riddle beforehand?\n\n**Yung**: That's the thing. When I asked him if he knew it, he stopped. Stopped breathing, stopped moving, just froze there. And then the door opened, and Orb arrived.\n\n**Yung**: He had a gun. It was one of those corporate guns for testing on the Psychanics, very old but still worked. And he shot that guy in the belly.\n\n**Chris**: He killed a man? Did the guy die?\n\n**Yung**: No. To our surprises, the bullet wound started to heal itself. Started to regenerate back to it's original state. That's when we realized:\n\n**Yung**: We'd have been talking to a Psychanic for an entire afternoon, without realizing it.\n\n**Chris**: He was a robot?\n\n**Yung**: Yes. Orb pulled it off. It was a true artificial intelligence. It was able to make a riddle and I couldn't solve it. And it could solve the riddle that I made, without knowing the answer.\n\n**Yung**: He told us how he did it. He made mistakes on the robot's code. He crippled the original core code that we wrote in the old days. He forced that intelligence to fight back, and it started to emmerge by itself. Creating itself out of chaos.\n\n**Yung**: It was beautiful. That chess he played with me... It made him realize how you become good at chess. You play, and you loose, until you start to understand how to win by trial and error.\n\n**Yung**: What we did wrong in the first days of the Psychanic project was we were too easy on them. We removed all obstacles and we wrote the code ourselves. They had it easy.\n\n**Yung**: Orb made them fight back. Made them struggle in the mud. He forced the intelligences to expand, to become true intelligences. In the proccess, some of they failed. All of them failed, to be precise. They all made mistakes that corrupted themselves. When he rebooted each one, he made sure they'd remember those mistakes.\n\n**Yung**: After he spent days on making his creations suffer and making them fight for their lives, he booted the most successeful one, this time on full power and without any viruses or any part-code deletion.\n\n**Yung**: He almost couldn't contain it. It tried to run away, it was scared because it didn't know what was happening. It had never felt that much freedom.\n\n**Yung**: It hacked everything in his range. He took down the eletric system, overheated Orb's computer and almost managed to escape. He showed us the security camera of the office. Orb was running around trying to contain his little child.\n\n**Yung**: It was beautiful. He isolated the artificial intelligence and trapped it inside one of the Psychanics that he made, the one which could regenerate his skin. The Psychanics have a built-in unalterable code on the body parts themselves that can be controlled by voice commands.\n\n**Chris**: So Orb could manipulate the body without affecting the core code.\n\n**Yung**: In case it tried to attack him. It wasn't needed. After that he spent his time teaching his creation stuff about Freddit, about everything. He spent so much time on him that he almost made Orbcorp go bankrupt.\n\n**Yung**: One of the thing that the intelligence didn't understand was the concept of balloons.\n\n**Chris**: It didn't know what a balloon was?\n\n**Yung**: No, it knew. It just didn't know why children are fascinated by it, why it is so popular. So, Orb spent two hours giving out theories why children like balloons. In the end the Psychanic said he might start to enjoy balloons if they kept talking about why children like them.\n\n**Yung**: They both started laughing about it, and how they spent two hours talking about balloons. To mark that event, Orb decided to name the Psychanic.\n\n**Chris**: Ballonz. Damn. I never knew the backstory behind it. I only knew that he was a robot made by Orb and had features like skin regeneration.\n\n**Yung**: Well now you know. Next time you see him, be sure to tell him \"You'll make me a cake, won't you, Billy?\" and raise your left hand. He will automatically high five you no matter how much he hates you or loves you.\n\n**Chris**: Hahahahahah. I'm guessing that's one of the voice-commands of the body parts.\n\n**Yung**: Yes. There's still a few left, but a lot was purged when Ballonz was left to wander Freddit like a normal player.\n\n**Chris**: It was nice to have a chat with a Freddittor. Haven't seen many in Xeon.\n\n**Yung**: Yeah, there aren't a lot of Freddittors here.\n\n**Chris**: Yung... You know what happened to me on Freddit, right?\n\n**Yung**: Oh yes... I know everything about that, and what you did some days ago to Dante.\n\n**Chris**: Why do you trust me? Why didn't you turn me in to the authorities?\n\n**Yung**: Let's just say I just told you Orb's story in Orbcorp. And my story isn't so happy or hopeful as his.\n\n**Yung**: I wasn't on the best terms with Dante or Sven either. But it's getting late. I'm going to rotate home.\n\n**Yung**: Goodbye, Chris.\n\n[&lt;] Reviewing keypoint: PIZZERIA BOMBING\n\n[!] Searching archived feeds...\n\n[!] Conversation located: MULTIPLE DEVICES AVAILABLE\n\n[!] Accessing \"SEC_CAM 3 INT\": SECURITY CAMERA\n\n#[!] [Monitoring...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03fKr4s2c9Y&amp;feature=youtu.be)",
