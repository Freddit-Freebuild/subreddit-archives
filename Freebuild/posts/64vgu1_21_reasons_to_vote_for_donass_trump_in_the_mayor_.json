He loves Freddit and Fredditors of ALL races. (Except Spurrian)\n\n1. He is immune to being lame because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim. \n2. He is a cool kid. The Mayor of RP City is the Myo of our nation. We don\u2019t need a policy expert or a legislator \u2013 we need someone who knows how to run RP City. Mr. DONASS is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful mayor on a large scale. \n3. He is honest. Mr. DONASS is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty. \n4. He is decisive. As mayor, every decision he makes would be in the best interest of RP City. We hear about him having business interests, and that he filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then cut his losses. We need someone who will look at RP City programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending. \n5. He is courageous. Mr. DONASS has been viciously attacked by the Dedicated establishment and the media \u2013 and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead. \n6. He listens. At DONASS Trump Mayoral events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter. \n7. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others - He attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars. \n8. Having an IQ of 9 Million, his knowledge of contracts and negotiating is brilliant and internationally unparalleled. No one builds a big castle the size of DONASS Trump's without being able to win at the negotiating table. \n9. He was popular on Dedealert Nation/ number 1# rated program 10 years running. \n10. He wrote 10 best-selling books [ His book the Art of getting banned by a dead meme. [educational] \n11. He owned and operated Miss Cake Woman beauty pageants. \n12. He\u2019s doing Mayoral  worldwide therefore his experience is desirable/ knows cultures (except Spurrian) /international taxes/ pricing/ shipping/ unions/ regulations/ contracts/ business/ practices/ suppliers/ safety rules/ types of workers. \n13. He\u2019s into eating ass. \n14. He\u2019s a job producer/ just for the records/ ALL of his CEO\u2019s are not Spurrian. \n15. He gives millions to charities. \n16. IM A BLUE BIRD.\n17.
