It is important that we keep our chat family friendly. Do not say anything in chat that you would not want your younger sibling to hear.\nHerobrine, Slenderman, or Five Nights at Freddy's. These topics can scare some of our younger friends.\n\nNo talking about \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018dating\u2019. These subjects can get out of control very quickly and are not really necessary for game play.\n\nNo bullying or name calling. At Freddit Freebuild, we want to be a safe haven from bullying. Because of this, unkind words will not be tolerated. We need to respect our friends.\n\nNo talking about religion. We know for some of our friends this is a very important part of their life, but Freddit is not a place for these kinds of conversations.\n\nNo violence. No talking about weapons or hurting anyone or anything, even jokingly.\n\nNo vulgar or bodily function humor.\n\nNo Spam. Sometimes chat is going really fast! It is okay to say it again later if you feel no one heard you but you don\u2019t need to say it a lot of times in a row.\n\nNo repeated letters or characters, like this: \u2018Nooooooooooo!\u2019 or \u2018No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u2019\n\nNo countdowns, like this: \u20185\u2019 \u20184\u2019 \u20183\u2019 \u20182\u2019 \u20181\u2019\n\nNo gibberish, like this: \u2018wkejhrlwkjebdlwkjebrlwiuer\u2019\n\nNo ascii or Unicode symbols, like this: \u2018\u263a\u2211\u06de\u2665\u266b\u266f '\n\nNo repeating chat lines, like this: \u2018I need wood\u2019 \u2018I need wood\u2019 \u2018I need wood\u2019\n\nNo harassing other players\n\nYou should not use public or private chat to repeatedly ask a player a question, make threats, call names, or send repeated /tpa requests. This makes other players feel uncomfortable and it can be considered as bullying. Please listen to your friends if they ask you to stop doing something or they tell you \u2018no\u2019.\n\nNo advertising\n\nThere will be no advertising of any other servers in any form. No talking about other servers, no telling people to go check your Enjin wall where you've posted your server or anything like that at all either on the Freddt server or in our forums.\n\nNo personal information. This information is personal and should not be shared over the internet. This is for your safety! Sharing this information in any form is not acceptable.\n\nNo giving out last names, school names, city names or any other identifying information; sharing your first name only, your age or your country/ state/province is general enough to be acceptable.\n\nNo requesting personal information from others in private or public chat.\n\nNo posting your phone number, email address or ip address.\n\nNo posting any screen name or friend ids for skype, playstation, xbox or any other web based device.\nEnglish Only (unless staff approved)\n\nWe understand that English might not be your first language, but it is the common language that all of our Admins and Helpers use on the server. We can only protect you from bullies and bad language in English. We request that all players speak English while on Freddit and on enjin unless you have Admin / Helper permission.\n\n**Roleplay reminders**\n\nRoleplay can be a lot of fun and it is a nice way to play with friends. However, our helpers and admins can\u2019t always tell who is playing and who really needs help! We need you to help us by putting \u2018rp:\u2019 before you type in a role play. Kind of like this \u2018rp: I need someone to save me!\u2019 We also ask that everyone who is playing a role play game remembers that all the same chat rules apply in role play as they do any other time.\n\n**Changing Username**\n\nIf you change your name to be the same as or similar to another player's name (especially ones that make others think you are staff, such as Jr/SrHelper, Admin, Broadcast, Console, ServerTech, Egg, etc.) and cause confusion, you will be removed from the whitelist for 30 days until you can change your name again. If you refuse to change your name at that time, or if you change it to be the same as someone else's name again, you will remain off the whitelist until you fix it.\n\n**Game Play Guidelines**\n\nNo cheating or hacking. If you feel it gives you an advantage over everyone else, chances are it's cheating.\n\nNo using \u2018duped\u2019 items. If you have found a way to do this, please let a helper or admin know.\n\nNo using any \u2018economy\u2019 dupes. You may not abuse any issues, glitches or bugs with economy to gain money.\n\nNo building AFK Machines/AFK Farms to prevent you from getting kicked due to inactivity or farming items/experience while idle.\n\nNo using unapproved mods. We like to keep it fair, so nothing like \u2018too many items\u2019 or x-rays mods can be used. Please review approved mods for a full list of what we allow on the server.\n\n**Protection Limits**\n\nTo have your area protected you can type \u2018/modreq please protect me\u2019, however, the build must be at least 30 blocks away from all other people's builds. We will not protect anything of yours if you build too close to someone else. Also, we will not expand your region if others have built around you. You or they will have to move. If your build is underground, please mark the edges of the build above the ground, so the admins know where to protect without having to go scope out your entire underground base.\n\n**No Griefing**\n\nEven if you are angry or upset with someone, griefing is not a good way to solve the problem. If you see griefing on your property you can type \u2018/modreq I was griefed\u2019 and an admin will take care of it. There is no reason for you try to do anything else.\n\nGriefing is:\n\nWhen you take a build that you did not do and you add or remove blocks from it. Even if it is not protected, you should not make any changes to it for any reason.\n\nWhen you kill another players pet, villager or golem.\n\nSteal crops\n\nTake anything out of an unprotected chest\n\nTry to protect a chest or door that is not yours for yourself\n\n**Pet Ownership**\n\nWe understand that people love to have pets and we fully support this! However, we have to set limits on pet ownership and how you handle them.\n\nWolves: You may have 5 wolves at any given time.\n\nOcelots: You may have 5 ocelots at any given time.\n\n* Do not leave any pets sitting in any area that is not yours. Admins will not know who they belong to and they will be removed and you will not have the opportunity to get the animal back.\n\n* Pets are not damage-proof! If you take them out of your area, they may not be safe. Wolves and cats are damaged by arrows and flames and wolves can take fall damage.\n\n* We recommend you keep pets safe at home.Take care of your pets in the game as you would a pet in real life.\n\nChickens: You may have 10 chickens at any given time.\n\nSheep: You may have 10 sheep at any given time.\n\nCows: You may have 10 cows at any given time.\n\nMooshies: You may have 10 mooshroom cows at any given time.\n\nPigs: You may have 10 pigs at any given time\n\nHorses: You may have 10 horses at any given time.\n\n* You may keep 1 horse out of your virtual stables at any given time, when you are not actually riding your other horses, please use /stables store and store them in the virtual stables.\n\n* Admins will store any horses they see on sight.\n\nVillagers: You may have 15 villagers at any given time.\n\n**Skins and Banners**\n\nIf your skin or banner is used with intent to scare, annoy, harass, or impose a view or position on to other players, a helper or admin may ask you to change your skin and/or remove the banner before returning to game play. Skins and Banners need to be family friendly including but not limited to:\n\nNo Herobrine, Creepypasta, or Five Nights at Freddy's skins.\n\nNo blood or gore of any kind on skins.\n\nNo indecent exposure or naked skins.\n\n**One Account Per Player**\n\nExperience tells us that multiple accounts are often used to avoid consequences of poor choices made on one or both accounts. A player's second account will be removed from our white-list immediately\n\n**Public Farms**\n\nIf you wish to build a public farm (crops, animals, etc) that the community can use, admins will only protect the land from the ground down. Anything else (crops, animals, buildings, etc) will not be protected or fixed by admins. If you build it, it's your responsibility to maintain it.\n\n**No Trapping Other Players**\n\nYou can not build anything, anywhere (your base, resource world or anywhere else) that can trap or kill another player. Any traps we find will be removed.\n\n#Consequences\n\nOn Freddit we try to be fair and understanding. We have several tools to help us maintain a safe and family friendly environment. What tool is used is at the discretion of the helper or admin on at the time. In most situations, there will be one or more verbal warnings in public and/or private message.\n\n**Note to Parents: If your child experiences any of these general consequences and you have a question, you can contact any admin or helper in game by using private chat or /helpop or you can send a message via enjin or our Facebook page. Please include your child\u2019s gameplay name when inquiring via email or Facebook so we can help you as quickly as possible.**\n\n**Mute**\n\nYou will be unable to send public or private messages, however you can reply to messages using /r. You may also use /helpop to gain the attention of any admin who is logged on at the time. Mutes are temporary and generally used for chat violations.\n\n**Jail**\nJail is a room that a player cannot break out of nor can they teleport or /spawn out. It is a special place where players are placed if we can\u2019t get their attention or we feel the player is making choices that require a \u2018break\u2019 from play. Jail is temporary, however some players may be asked to stay in that area until their parents can be contacted to help us help the player better understands the rules.\n\n**Ban**\n\nIn extreme cases, players who repeatedly make poor choices will be temporarily unable to access the Freddit server. The timeframe is at the discretion of the admins, however some players will remain banned until their parents can be contacted to help us help the player better understands the rules.\n\n#Have a good day on Freddit, the best server!\n\n- Zoocanadanda, moderator of Freddit Freebuild.",

Wolves and cats are damaged by arrows and flames and wolves can take fall damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend you keep pets safe at home.Take care of your pets in the game as you would a pet in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chickens: You may have 10 chickens at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sheep: You may have 10 sheep at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cows: You may have 10 cows at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mooshies: You may have 10 mooshroom cows at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pigs: You may have 10 pigs at any given time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Horses: You may have 10 horses at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may keep 1 horse out of your virtual stables at any given time, when you are not actually riding your other horses, please use /stables store and store them in the virtual stables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admins will store any horses they see on sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Villagers: You may have 15 villagers at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skins and Banners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your skin or banner is used with intent to scare, annoy, harass, or impose a view or position on to other players, a helper or admin may ask you to change your skin and/or remove the banner before returning to game play. Skins and Banners need to be family friendly including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No Herobrine, Creepypasta, or Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#39;s skins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No blood or gore of any kind on skins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No indecent exposure or naked skins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Account Per Player&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Experience tells us that multiple accounts are often used to avoid consequences of poor choices made on one or both accounts. A player&amp;#39;s second account will be removed from our white-list immediately&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Farms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wish to build a public farm (crops, animals, etc) that the community can use, admins will only protect the land from the ground down. Anything else (crops, animals, buildings, etc) will not be protected or fixed by admins. If you build it, it&amp;#39;s your responsibility to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Trapping Other Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can not build anything, anywhere (your base, resource world or anywhere else) that can trap or kill another player. Any traps we find will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Consequences&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Freddit we try to be fair and understanding. We have several tools to help us maintain a safe and family friendly environment. What tool is used is at the discretion of the helper or admin on at the time. In most situations, there will be one or more verbal warnings in public and/or private message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to Parents: If your child experiences any of these general consequences and you have a question, you can contact any admin or helper in game by using private chat or /helpop or you can send a message via enjin or our Facebook page. Please include your child\u2019s gameplay name when inquiring via email or Facebook so we can help you as quickly as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be unable to send public or private messages, however you can reply to messages using /r. You may also use /helpop to gain the attention of any admin who is logged on at the time. Mutes are temporary and generally used for chat violations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jail&lt;/strong&gt;\nJail is a room that a player cannot break out of nor can they teleport or /spawn out. It is a special place where players are placed if we can\u2019t get their attention or we feel the player is making choices that require a \u2018break\u2019 from play. Jail is temporary, however some players may be asked to stay in that area until their parents can be contacted to help us help the player better understands the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In extreme cases, players who repeatedly make poor choices will be temporarily unable to access the Freddit server. The timeframe is at the discretion of the admins, however some players will remain banned until their parents can be contacted to help us help the player better understands the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Have a good day on Freddit, the best server!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zoocanadanda, moderator of Freddit Freebuild.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
