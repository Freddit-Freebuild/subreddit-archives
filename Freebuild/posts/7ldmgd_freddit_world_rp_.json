Planetary Sales, World Acquisition &amp; Distribution of Land are giving a **FREE** opportunity to join in a worldwide RP! And we mean that literally!\n\nWe will have an exact replica of our own world put in Freddit, in which you may claim a nation - **_for free!_**. It's empty, only the environment there to greet you - so make sure to not mess that up!\n\nMany people have claimed their lands, in fact, they've even created factions! That's right, that's another thing (though optional) of this wonderful event: **War RP!** \n\nDon't like that smelly commie over the border? Do you think Jarab should be moved afterall? Perhaps the US should've been nuked to kingdom come back in the Cold War? **_Well aren't you a lucky fellow!_** You can annex land by either challenging the owner of that land to a duel (capture the flag, regular PVP, bed wars, connect 4, whatever floats BOTH of your boats) OR you can try to give that person money to get it.\n\nPerhaps you'd like that empty piece of land, not occupied by anyone... Well, though a lot of empty pieces of land are indeed free, another lot cost money - which you get, every week, a random budget between **1,000$** and **1,000,000$** (prices could be changed in the future).\n\nPerhaps more than one nation would like that fine piece of land. Well fear not, you may either duel it out with any battle option or you may go into an auction, and whoever bids higher, _gets the land!_ Isn't that wonderful?\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, enough of the basic mechanics of the RP. Let's talk _war_. More specifically, who are the two major factions? \n\n#The 4th Reich &amp; The Entente\n\nBut must you join these? No, my fellow Freddittor, you may be alone - **INDEPENDENT** - or you can skip all the war altogether: **BE NEUTRAL!**\n\n**WARNING**: NEUTRAL NATIONS CANNOT ATTACK OR BE ATTACKED. Any attack on neutral nations will be treated as griefing. \n\n---\n\nBuild in creative, duel it out in survival. And please, respect the borders. Also, T.B.C. is the official worldwide government, if you have any doubts or quarrels to set, contact us! We're always on *YOUR* side!\n\nYou may only edit your own nation. In conquered nations, please do not destroy or edit something extremely, unless the conquered person doesn't mind.\n\n---\n\n**FURTHER QUESTIONS?**\n\nAsk me. Also, please, it's the first week of this RP. It's in BETA. Things could get messy but stay on track. Conquering unoccupied land is done through T.B.C. Bank (unless theres more than one person wanting it, then itd be settled with a duel or an auction), conquering occupied land is done through a duel or buying the occupation's owner money (if he accepts).\n\nYou must have a valid reason to try to conquer occupied land. If you think someone is challenging you to a duel for land due to not-good-enough reasons, take it to T.B.C. We'll decide if it's fair arguments, or just total bollocks!\n\n---\n\nThank you for choosing T.B.C., from day-to-day comodities to worldwide domination, we're always there for ya.\n\n- Zoo Man, global C.E.O. of T.B.C.",
