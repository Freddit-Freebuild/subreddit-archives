At that time I had been playing Overwatch, which frustrated me, causing stress, and my toxicity. All of my arguments were just, well, dumb. Most of them being with Zoo, and for which, I am sorry. My points were irrational, and I can\u2019t explain what I was even thinking in any of those particular moments. Every time I apologized after my arguments and toxicity, I always said that I would change. Afterwards, I made no effort to do so whatsoever. I acknowledge this, and I realize that I should\u2019ve. At the time I didn\u2019t know what the problem was, and I didn\u2019t know how to fix it. But now, I do. I\u2019ve been making an effort lately to be as nice and non-toxic as possible to people. In Fortnite, (the pve version, not the pvp) I recently gave another person a weapon that I had, that they didn\u2019t have. They told me that they\u2019d give me the materials to craft it, but after checking their backpack and storage, they didn\u2019t. So I just crafted the weapon with my own materials, and gave it to that other person. That felt good, to do something nice, for once. That specific interaction made me realize that I needed to change for the better. I needed to not be such an irrational and bad person.I\u2019m sorry for everything I did and said, I take full responsibility. If I could look any of you in the eye and sincerely say that I\u2019m sorry. I would.\n\nI am very, and sincerely sorry for the emotional stress that I caused over those past months.From, Faz.  \nEdit: This isn't meant to be a ban appeal, as I didn't tag it as such.
