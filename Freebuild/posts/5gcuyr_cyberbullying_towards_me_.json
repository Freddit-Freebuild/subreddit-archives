I mean a LOT of times people say certain things to him without him provoking them, even if it's just \"creating a company that's better than SpurrCo\" could be offensive and could drive him to salt point. A LOT of times he freaks out on things that we cause, and if we took it as trying to explain to a community member what's going on rather than explaining to a salty fuck boy and with smart comebacks and flamewars maybe it'd be better for everyone.

I am fine with me being portrayed like a cringy saltlord in comics and stuff, but when people actually think I am like that, it saddens me. The cyberbullying has now reached a point where it is the norm to make fun of me. That is disgusting. A large portion of Drama starts out with people bullying me, and then I naturally get upset.

This does not only happen to me though, Faz is also stuck in the Cyberbullying Loop.

He says fuck you to a lot of people just because they disagree with him. He tells people to shut up when they have different opinions, the most recent example I can think of is when he said JAFC must be manager and when someone disagreed he got all angry towards them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
