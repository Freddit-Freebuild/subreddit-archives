Creating a new channel, kicking/banning some users out of the discord, talking in staff discussions, etc.\n\n**Admins** will tend to focus on major decisions and server functionalities.

Owners is pretty much self-explanatory.\n\n---\n\nNote 1: with this new staff reform act, **there's a bigger difference between each rank**, and thus allows for people with certain skills be granted permissions and be allowed to rank up to the best fitting role.\n\nNote 2: **responsibilities are hereditary** - example, an admin should have mods' responsibilities/duties but have a bigger focus on the new ones, such as, major decision making, helping Owners decide on server plans, helping execute certain server plans, add or remove certain plugins, help all the staff members and oversee the staff team.\n\n---\n\n**Shared responsibilities:** kicking, muting, staff discussions, griefs, server threats, server plans, all those things and more, are shared responsibilities - all staff weigh in, all staff have a say in the decision making process.\n\n---\n\n**Read the official T.B.C.
