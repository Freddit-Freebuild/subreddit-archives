Planetary Sales, World Acquisition &amp; Distribution of Land are giving a **FREE** opportunity to join in a worldwide RP! And we mean that literally!\n\nWe will have an exact replica of our own world put in Freddit, in which you may claim a nation - **_for free!_**. It's empty, only the environment there to greet you - so make sure to not mess that up!\n\nMany people have claimed their lands, in fact, they've even created factions! That's right, that's another thing (though optional) of this wonderful event: **War RP!** \n\nDon't like that smelly commie over the border? Do you think Jarab should be moved afterall? Perhaps the US should've been nuked to kingdom come back in the Cold War? **_Well aren't you a lucky fellow!_** You can annex land by either challenging the owner of that land to a duel (capture the flag, regular PVP, bed wars, connect 4, whatever floats BOTH of your boats) OR you can try to give that person money to get it.\n\nPerhaps you'd like that empty piece of land, not occupied by anyone... Well, though a lot of empty pieces of land are indeed free, another lot cost money - which you get, every week, a random budget between **1,000$** and **1,000,000$** (prices could be changed in the future).\n\nPerhaps more than one nation would like that fine piece of land. Well fear not, you may either duel it out with any battle option or you may go into an auction, and whoever bids higher, _gets the land!_ Isn't that wonderful?\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, enough of the basic mechanics of the RP. Let's talk _war_. More specifically, who are the two major factions? \n\n#The 4th Reich &amp; The Entente\n\nBut must you join these? No, my fellow Freddittor, you may be alone - **INDEPENDENT** - or you can skip all the war altogether: **BE NEUTRAL!**\n\n**WARNING**: NEUTRAL NATIONS CANNOT ATTACK OR BE ATTACKED. Any attack on neutral nations will be treated as griefing. \n\n---\n\nBuild in creative, duel it out in survival. And please, respect the borders. Also, T.B.C. is the official worldwide government, if you have any doubts or quarrels to set, contact us! We're always on *YOUR* side!\n\nYou may only edit your own nation. In conquered nations, please do not destroy or edit something extremely, unless the conquered person doesn't mind.\n\n---\n\n**FURTHER QUESTIONS?**\n\nAsk me. Also, please, it's the first week of this RP. It's in BETA. Things could get messy but stay on track. Conquering unoccupied land is done through T.B.C. Bank (unless theres more than one person wanting it, then itd be settled with a duel or an auction), conquering occupied land is done through a duel or buying the occupation's owner money (if he accepts).\n\nYou must have a valid reason to try to conquer occupied land. If you think someone is challenging you to a duel for land due to not-good-enough reasons, take it to T.B.C. We'll decide if it's fair arguments, or just total bollocks!\n\n---\n\nThank you for choosing T.B.C., from day-to-day comodities to worldwide domination, we're always there for ya.\n\n- Zoo Man, global C.E.O. of T.B.C.",

This doesn't mean I'll never be back, but almost nobody will be able to contact me anymore after I'm gone. If I decide to ever come back, this will change... but I want to at least stay a final goodbye to everyone. Everyone I can think of, at least. Here we go.\n\n\n----\n\nZoo: You're a pretty cool guy. I remember having multiple opinions about you over time. At first I just saw you as a staff member, I think. At most points when I was Moderator for the first time, I felt like you actively hated me.  Not entirely sure why I thought that, but it was probably due to the fake wall I made at the 'staff base'. Remember that? You had me remove it because I was spamming chat with it and it was overall pointless. Nowadays though, I know you're just a nice guy.\n\n\n\nSven: You're a bit weird, but everyone thinks that. Been a bit weirder with you too, at one point knowing nothing about you, and then we were friends, and then you helped with some things, canceled some others, blah blah blah. Overall, you're a pretty cool guy, too.\n\n\n\nToad: I miss when we were good friends. I wish we could have resolved things better.\n\n\nMilk: You're still a pretty nice guy but due to your business I thought you were avoiding me. I don't think that anymore. Keep being cool... even though Bad_Milk is probably already spoiled.\n\n\nPsy: There would be too much to say, so I don't know if I can. You're my best friend for sure and I'm glad I met you.\n\n\nWaving: I'm glad we're friends now. What happened in the past was rocky though, from us being friends as mods/admins, to being enemies as owners, to being friends again now. Certainly glad we met, too.\n\n\nPoko: Yep, I'm even including you, but I doubt you'll see this. I saw you as just the owner at first, and then I saw you as a friend for a while. Always thought it was weird that you drew porn, especially me from the past-- but me thinking that hasn't changed all that much. We were never that close, but I wonder what ever drove us apart.\n\n\n\nZach: Haven't known you for long, but you're a cool guy. All I really have to say.\n\n\nNido: Good friend. Has always been. I think we played some Pokemon together too, or at least talked about it. \n\n\nOrb: Always level-headed, and has always been a nice and cool guy. Good friend, too. One of the main reasons I wanted to come back to Freddit was for OrbCorp and all of that stuff. Guess this kinda applies to Nido a bit, too.\n\n\nJAFC: Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn't be allowed to run servers.\n\n\nWoger: Wait, who is this? I don't remember them.\n\n\nNepeta: Always been weird with you. At first when we first met we were practically best friends, back when you had a Mettaton skin. As time went on, we were still friends, but never as close, like when I became mod for the first time-- you got REALLY mad and thought I was super unqualified. And then, you became Owner on Reversal, and I guess the whole situation was reversed from the other. I'm not entirely sure what you think of me now, but you're a interesting individual. Glad I met you, I think.\n\n\nSteam: In many ways, you've been a good friend. I don't really remember exactly when or how we first met, but I remember you were iFirePanda. Remember that?\n\n\nDrydon: At first, I always thought of you as being like, Zoo's second hand guy. I mostly thought that because of your breaking bad comic, but I was wrong on that assumption. Just thought I'd say that-- you're a nice guy, too.\n\n\nNueSB: Always been a cool guy! I met you during your creation of the 'frooble gang', which I don't think was ever finished. We were going to make 'NAF', a fangame based on these. You made a concept, but we never got it made. I also remember that rabb.it you were in, and boy, that was awesome. Definitely hope to meet you again.\n\n\nEbola: I met you around that time too (mentioned above). I basically just called you over for no reason and over time we became friends, with me helping in some things like Eboland 2 and such. Not to mention the rabb.it's we did, and Ebolabs? That was all fun. Hope to meet you again, too. BOOM BOOM FIREPOWER\n\n\nStick: You were also always cool. I don't really have all that much to say, though.\n\n\nBobpotatoman/Supermatt: You were also awesome! We first met when I helped you with CMD Blocks, I think.  You built some awesome dark rides and I hope you'll live on your dream to make real ones.\n\n\nLeaf: I remember meeting you when you made some cool builds, mostly pixel art. You also drew some cool stuff, IIRC. And then you started drawing porn-- which kinda caused a chain reaction in everything. I don't really remember us being 'close-friends', though. I wanted you to be staff at one point for some reason though, if that means anything. Koopa\n\n\nZelda: I remember when you first joined and you wanted to make some stuff, and you needed OP. You were granted it multiple times eventually, and you've changed a LOT since then... besides the love of Halo. I don't know if how you are is better or worse, but you're still a pretty cool guy.\n\n\nJessesonic: Never talked much with you, at first kinda had a bad opinion from you when you tested the \"fop_sop\" thing, but you actually proved it didn't work if anything. I remember that voice chat, and you taught me a little about cheese. Like many others, a cool guy.\n\n\nSpurr: Oh, boy, you're such a mixed bag. From the library, to the 'fake OP' accident, from 'hi jAft', from the 'spurrlore stories'... Could easily focus on all of those bad things more, but I also remember a lot of times you were cool, and some times where you were antagonized wrongly. Certainly gonna miss you.\n\n\nRick: I built you some CMD things, I've been in Rickscord for the longest time, blah blah. You're a interesting guy.\n\n\nPig: I'm actually still staff in your discord! Won't matter since I'm leaving, but I've done absolutely nothing in there. You've always been a pretty great guy.\n\n\nFruit: I've always thought of you similar to Pig. You guys are pretty similar, and you're both pretty awesome.\n\n\nPluff: I remember you being pretty cool and always thinking of 'Jigglypuff' when seeing your name. Cool guy, once again.\n\n\nMalpoiuytrew: I helped you build a castle on one of the first days I joined! You didn't have worldedit perms, for some reason. After that, you were always pretty cool.\n\n\n\nRandom: I remember we've been friends for a good while. You're a nice guy, and you totally had the whole squid thing before Nido did. You should sue. \n\n\nMegalexMaster: Just including you because I remember your skin looked like Vortex Armor from Terraria... you also did a whole stunt thing when you left, which was pretty weird. The warp is still on the server, actually! First page of /warp. I don't recall much about you, but I think you were pretty cool?\n\n\nUbinox: I remember one day you came on, and I recall everybody loving you for some reason. Not saying they had no reason, either: you're also a cool guy.\n\n\nLolMech: Nice guy, but never really got to know you too well. Your PVP thing actually reminds me of the FNAF PVP back when me and Poke and others worked on it. That was a long time ago. That's probably why I felt so nostalgic around you.\n\n\nSoda: You used to have a obsession with Cars, now you're obsessed with Taylor Swift. I remember you being a really nice guy and I've always associated you with Fanta. You're a awesome guy.\n\n\n\nDedi: I remember when you first joined and I nicknamed you 'DedidatedWam'. I thought that was really funny, and you did too. It wasn't all that funny, though. You eventually seemed to come to hate me, but... I'm not sure what you think of me now. I think you're a pretty cool guy, though.\n\n\nLeedle: I don't know you all that well, but you seem like a alright guy. You draw super great, too. You also have a similar porn thing with Ghire, but that's not important. I didn't know you all that long, but you're a pretty nice guy.\n\n\nRubii: From when I was back, I talked to you a good deal, and I'd say we were friends. You draw great and animate great. You're pretty awesome, too.\n\nChris: can't believe I forgot to add you at first, you're freakin' Chris. I keep remembering you as leaving as Owner because someone wanted some 'rank points', they got from someone else... That was a dumb system. You've always been awesome and we actually share some things in common, which is interesting. Nice to have met you.\n\n\nPigLadAI: always been pretty awesome. you made some cool shitposts, too. i agree with you that some things weren't positive but I remember there were times that were. cool guy like many others-- glad to have met you.\n\n\nJeffrey: Definitely a cool guy. It's funny that even though Pres was pretending to be you, you turned out to be a WAY cooler guy. Infinitely cooler. But it's not even fair to compare you to him-- glad we met.\n\n----\n\n\nIf I missed you, please let me know. I wrote this at 5 AM. Really sorry if I did.\n\n\nI'm not leaving just yet, but I'm certainly getting ready for it. I'm likely not going to be on tomorrow for a while, but I'll probably leave sometime around then. \n\n\n[Yee Haw!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GUWXF3LIy8)\n\n\n^^yes, ^^that ^^is ^^written ^^by ^^the ^^creator ^^of ^^the ^^song ^^\"Yee ^^Haw\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What happened in the past was rocky though, from us being friends as mods/admins, to being enemies as owners, to being friends again now. Certainly glad we met, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poko: Yep, I&amp;#39;m even including you, but I doubt you&amp;#39;ll see this. I saw you as just the owner at first, and then I saw you as a friend for a while. Always thought it was weird that you drew porn, especially me from the past-- but me thinking that hasn&amp;#39;t changed all that much. We were never that close, but I wonder what ever drove us apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zach: Haven&amp;#39;t known you for long, but you&amp;#39;re a cool guy. All I really have to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nido: Good friend. Has always been. I think we played some Pokemon together too, or at least talked about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orb: Always level-headed, and has always been a nice and cool guy. Good friend, too. One of the main reasons I wanted to come back to Freddit was for OrbCorp and all of that stuff. Guess this kinda applies to Nido a bit, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JAFC: Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to run servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woger: Wait, who is this? I don&amp;#39;t remember them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nepeta: Always been weird with you. At first when we first met we were practically best friends, back when you had a Mettaton skin. As time went on, we were still friends, but never as close, like when I became mod for the first time-- you got REALLY mad and thought I was super unqualified. And then, you became Owner on Reversal, and I guess the whole situation was reversed from the other. I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure what you think of me now, but you&amp;#39;re a interesting individual. Glad I met you, I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steam: In many ways, you&amp;#39;ve been a good friend. I don&amp;#39;t really remember exactly when or how we first met, but I remember you were iFirePanda. Remember that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drydon: At first, I always thought of you as being like, Zoo&amp;#39;s second hand guy. I mostly thought that because of your breaking bad comic, but I was wrong on that assumption. Just thought I&amp;#39;d say that-- you&amp;#39;re a nice guy, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NueSB: Always been a cool guy! I met you during your creation of the &amp;#39;frooble gang&amp;#39;, which I don&amp;#39;t think was ever finished. We were going to make &amp;#39;NAF&amp;#39;, a fangame based on these. You made a concept, but we never got it made. I also remember that rabb.it you were in, and boy, that was awesome. Definitely hope to meet you again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ebola: I met you around that time too (mentioned above). I basically just called you over for no reason and over time we became friends, with me helping in some things like Eboland 2 and such. Not to mention the rabb.it&amp;#39;s we did, and Ebolabs? That was all fun. Hope to meet you again, too. BOOM BOOM FIREPOWER&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stick: You were also always cool. I don&amp;#39;t really have all that much to say, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bobpotatoman/Supermatt: You were also awesome! We first met when I helped you with CMD Blocks, I think.  You built some awesome dark rides and I hope you&amp;#39;ll live on your dream to make real ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaf: I remember meeting you when you made some cool builds, mostly pixel art. You also drew some cool stuff, IIRC. And then you started drawing porn-- which kinda caused a chain reaction in everything. I don&amp;#39;t really remember us being &amp;#39;close-friends&amp;#39;, though. I wanted you to be staff at one point for some reason though, if that means anything. Koopa&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zelda: I remember when you first joined and you wanted to make some stuff, and you needed OP. You were granted it multiple times eventually, and you&amp;#39;ve changed a LOT since then... besides the love of Halo. I don&amp;#39;t know if how you are is better or worse, but you&amp;#39;re still a pretty cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jessesonic: Never talked much with you, at first kinda had a bad opinion from you when you tested the &amp;quot;fop_sop&amp;quot; thing, but you actually proved it didn&amp;#39;t work if anything. I remember that voice chat, and you taught me a little about cheese. Like many others, a cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spurr: Oh, boy, you&amp;#39;re such a mixed bag. From the library, to the &amp;#39;fake OP&amp;#39; accident, from &amp;#39;hi jAft&amp;#39;, from the &amp;#39;spurrlore stories&amp;#39;... Could easily focus on all of those bad things more, but I also remember a lot of times you were cool, and some times where you were antagonized wrongly. Certainly gonna miss you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rick: I built you some CMD things, I&amp;#39;ve been in Rickscord for the longest time, blah blah. You&amp;#39;re a interesting guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pig: I&amp;#39;m actually still staff in your discord! Won&amp;#39;t matter since I&amp;#39;m leaving, but I&amp;#39;ve done absolutely nothing in there. You&amp;#39;ve always been a pretty great guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fruit: I&amp;#39;ve always thought of you similar to Pig. You guys are pretty similar, and you&amp;#39;re both pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pluff: I remember you being pretty cool and always thinking of &amp;#39;Jigglypuff&amp;#39; when seeing your name. Cool guy, once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Malpoiuytrew: I helped you build a castle on one of the first days I joined! You didn&amp;#39;t have worldedit perms, for some reason. After that, you were always pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Random: I remember we&amp;#39;ve been friends for a good while. You&amp;#39;re a nice guy, and you totally had the whole squid thing before Nido did. You should sue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MegalexMaster: Just including you because I remember your skin looked like Vortex Armor from Terraria... you also did a whole stunt thing when you left, which was pretty weird. The warp is still on the server, actually! First page of /warp. I don&amp;#39;t recall much about you, but I think you were pretty cool?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ubinox: I remember one day you came on, and I recall everybody loving you for some reason. Not saying they had no reason, either: you&amp;#39;re also a cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LolMech: Nice guy, but never really got to know you too well. Your PVP thing actually reminds me of the FNAF PVP back when me and Poke and others worked on it. That was a long time ago. That&amp;#39;s probably why I felt so nostalgic around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soda: You used to have a obsession with Cars, now you&amp;#39;re obsessed with Taylor Swift. I remember you being a really nice guy and I&amp;#39;ve always associated you with Fanta. You&amp;#39;re a awesome guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dedi: I remember when you first joined and I nicknamed you &amp;#39;DedidatedWam&amp;#39;. I thought that was really funny, and you did too. It wasn&amp;#39;t all that funny, though. You eventually seemed to come to hate me, but... I&amp;#39;m not sure what you think of me now. I think you&amp;#39;re a pretty cool guy, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leedle: I don&amp;#39;t know you all that well, but you seem like a alright guy. You draw super great, too. You also have a similar porn thing with Ghire, but that&amp;#39;s not important. I didn&amp;#39;t know you all that long, but you&amp;#39;re a pretty nice guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rubii: From when I was back, I talked to you a good deal, and I&amp;#39;d say we were friends. You draw great and animate great. You&amp;#39;re pretty awesome, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chris: can&amp;#39;t believe I forgot to add you at first, you&amp;#39;re freakin&amp;#39; Chris. I keep remembering you as leaving as Owner because someone wanted some &amp;#39;rank points&amp;#39;, they got from someone else... That was a dumb system. You&amp;#39;ve always been awesome and we actually share some things in common, which is interesting. Nice to have met you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PigLadAI: always been pretty awesome. you made some cool shitposts, too. i agree with you that some things weren&amp;#39;t positive but I remember there were times that were. cool guy like many others-- glad to have met you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey: Definitely a cool guy. It&amp;#39;s funny that even though Pres was pretending to be you, you turned out to be a WAY cooler guy. Infinitely cooler. But it&amp;#39;s not even fair to compare you to him-- glad we met.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I missed you, please let me know. I wrote this at 5 AM. Really sorry if I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not leaving just yet, but I&amp;#39;m certainly getting ready for it. I&amp;#39;m likely not going to be on tomorrow for a while, but I&amp;#39;ll probably leave sometime around then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GUWXF3LIy8\"&gt;Yee Haw!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;yes,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;that&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;is&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;written&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;creator&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;song&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;quot;Yee&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Haw&amp;quot;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "The Underground has become a mess.\n\n**Entry 1:** Inactivity. The Underground is completely inactive. The most monsters I see outside everyday are 2-3, and even that's becoming rarer. Now, I get it-- it's the most inactive time of the year, but the surface is so much more active that it really feels like the Underground is truly dying.\n\n**Entry 2:** Deterioration of the kingdom. Magic is gone for one, so that absolutely sucks. I miss them. Asgore is also constantly sad. I'm serious. Just go to his castle, check it out! It's a gallery of Toriel porn! There seems to be nothing new happening, either. I heard Asgore was naming a new area: something he's just pulled from the shelf of namegeneration.com, no doubt. Sounds really special, doesn't it? Instead of a cool name made just for us, it's just... New Home. Equal to any other Gen 1 Pokemon name.\n\n**Entry 3:** Staff. Let's be honest here, the staff are not very good right now. I'm not trying to mindlessly offend anyone, but it's just a fact that the current staff team is not good. I'm going to break-down all of the royalty members, but instead of just offending them, I'm going to try to actually state the problems with them and how they moderate the server:\n\nToriel. I'd consider Peach the 'community mom'. That is NOT a bad thing. She monitors the community and deals with most drama situations. This is all fine, but... She's letting the kingdom deteriorate. She's not focusing on it. She's also constantly focused on children, but I might just think that due to our timezones.\n\nAsgore. The 'king'. He works on the kingdom and does what he can to improve it-- but he doesn't seem to really add all that much. And when he does, it's usually removed. He also seems to be restricted from doing anything else-- if he makes a community decision, all of the others backlash instantly.\n\nPapyrus. He... doesn't really do much of anything. He's hunting humans often sure, and he does solve some problems here and there, but he doesn't really do much staff related... I mean, creates puzzles for respective humans, but... that doesn't really count.\n\nMettaton. Mettaton seems to be the most active in the kingdom. He likes to make cool things and work on MTT: The Musical and MTTcorp. He does arrest people sometimes, but it feels more like he uses his celebrity rank just to make cool things. Not saying that's bad-- but he's left and rejoined as star multiple times for a reason. He doesn't really do much of the other staff stuff.\n\nAlphys. Active in the kingdom, and that's about it. Last time I tried to get her to do things she started watching anime instead. Doesn't really know how to do much either... and it doesn't really help that royal laws are messed up. No offense to her, but certainly not really a good royal scientist.\n\nSans. Wait, he's staff? I keep forgetting because he suffers a similar problem: doesn't really do staff things, and he's not even in the Underground that often, much less the Earthbound universe. Good guy: bad staff member.\n\nMuffet. Bakes very well! Doesn't do staff very well. I don't think I've ever seen her do any staff tasks at all.\n\nUndyne/The Undying/Fish Furry. A woman who goes by many names. She seems to do some staff things, and is maybe... 2nd staff most active in the kingdom after Mettaton? I haven't seen her do all that much staff stuff other than throwing spears at things and trying to be a likeable character.\n\nTemmie: hOI, go FoCK urself I'm tEM and Yuu cen eAT ShiT!!\u00bf\n\n**Entry 4:** Expanding the Underground. People who fall in don't stay. They're asked 'are you human?' by staff a few times, and then they're killed, never to be seen again. The Underground is not welcoming to new fallers, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay.\n\n**Entry 5:** 'Sexual' moments. The Undernet has gone way too far with this. First were the fanfics. They were one thing and they certainly messed me up the first time I saw them, and that was a long time ago. I think these things have gone even more overboard, though. The fanfics were messed up for sure, but they weren't on too often, and they were certainly 100% just for comedy. However, a lot of these things are serious now. People asking for yiff drawn, people talking about Toriel's Tits all the time, it's gone way overboard. And **JERRY** is also a large problem with this. The stories he makes up are even worse than the Fanfic Gen ever was. He goes super-overboard. I'm honestly getting sick of it-- and it's super weird. Like, these characters sorta represent the monsters in the Underground, and they're drawn fucking each other. You can NOT seriously think that that is not messed up.\n\n**Entry 6:** There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I've been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can't really decide if I really could leave. It's sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was royal scientist for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Underground time. Everything was active, things were good. and the war hadn't really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don't know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don't see it coming back, so I don't really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now.\n\nThat's all I have to say for now.\n\n**Edit:** \u270b \ud83d\udca3\u270b\u261d\u261f\u2744 \u270c\u2639\ud83d\udca7\u2690 \ud83d\udca3\u270c\ud83d\ude10\u261c \u270c \ud83d\udd6f\ud83d\udc4e\u270b\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udc4d\u2690\u263c\ud83d\udc4e \ud83d\udca7\u261c\u263c\u271e\u261c\u263c \ud83c\udff1\u2690\ud83d\udca7\u2744\ud83d\udd6f \u270c\ud83d\udc4c\u2690\ud83d\udd46\u2744 \ud83c\udff1\u261c\u2690\ud83c\udff1\u2639\u261c \ud83d\udd48\u261f\u2690 \u2744\u261f\u270b\u2620\ud83d\ude10 \u2744\u261f\u270c\u2744 \u2744\u261f\u261c \ud83d\udca3\u270b\u2620\u261c\ud83d\udc4d\u263c\u270c\u261e\u2744 \ud83d\udca7\u261c\u263c\u271e\u261c\u263c \ud83c\udff1\u2690\u263c\u2744\u270b\u2690\u2620 \u270b\ud83d\udca7 \u270b\u263c\u263c\u261c\u2639\u261c\u271e\u270c\u2620\u2744\n\n- W.D.

The Undernet has gone way too far with this. First were the fanfics. They were one thing and they certainly messed me up the first time I saw them, and that was a long time ago. I think these things have gone even more overboard, though. The fanfics were messed up for sure, but they weren&amp;#39;t on too often, and they were certainly 100% just for comedy. However, a lot of these things are serious now. People asking for yiff drawn, people talking about Toriel&amp;#39;s Tits all the time, it&amp;#39;s gone way overboard. And &lt;strong&gt;JERRY&lt;/strong&gt; is also a large problem with this. The stories he makes up are even worse than the Fanfic Gen ever was. He goes super-overboard. I&amp;#39;m honestly getting sick of it-- and it&amp;#39;s super weird. Like, these characters sorta represent the monsters in the Underground, and they&amp;#39;re drawn fucking each other. You can NOT seriously think that that is not messed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry 6:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can&amp;#39;t really decide if I really could leave. It&amp;#39;s sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was royal scientist for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Underground time. Everything was active, things were good. and the war hadn&amp;#39;t really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don&amp;#39;t know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don&amp;#39;t see it coming back, so I don&amp;#39;t really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I have to say for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; \u270b \ud83d\udca3\u270b\u261d\u261f\u2744 \u270c\u2639\ud83d\udca7\u2690 \ud83d\udca3\u270c\ud83d\ude10\u261c \u270c \ud83d\udd6f\ud83d\udc4e\u270b\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udc4d\u2690\u263c\ud83d\udc4e \ud83d\udca7\u261c\u263c\u271e\u261c\u263c \ud83c\udff1\u2690\ud83d\udca7\u2744\ud83d\udd6f \u270c\ud83d\udc4c\u2690\ud83d\udd46\u2744 \ud83c\udff1\u261c\u2690\ud83c\udff1\u2639\u261c \ud83d\udd48\u261f\u2690 \u2744\u261f\u270b\u2620\ud83d\ude10 \u2744\u261f\u270c\u2744 \u2744\u261f\u261c \ud83d\udca3\u270b\u2620\u261c\ud83d\udc4d\u263c\u270c\u261e\u2744 \ud83d\udca7\u261c\u263c\u271e\u261c\u263c \ud83c\udff1\u2690\u263c\u2744\u270b\u2690\u2620 \u270b\ud83d\udca7 \u270b\u263c\u263c\u261c\u2639\u261c\u271e\u270c\u2620\u2744&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;W.D.

I feel like there's some stuff he got wrong, and some valid points he brought up.\n\nThis is not at all a witch hunt or trying to start a flame war, JAFC's post was well put together with no inflamatory swings and it's his opinion and it's good and honest feedback, which me and the rest of the staff appreciate. But there's some stuff I feel like I need to address to explain or to correct, so that's why I'm making this post.\n\n---\n\n_Part 1: Inactivity. The server is completely inactive. The most users I see everyday are 2-3, and even that's becoming rarer. Now, I get it-- it's the most inactive time of the year, but the Discord is so much more active that it really feels like the server is truly dying._\n\nAlmost everyone on the server agree Freddit is a discord community with a Minecraft server. Not the other way around. The discord is active, with some slow periods during the day due to timezones + school. People usually come together on the server to do a particular thing - RP, filming, building a project together.\n\nThis means if you want to check up on Freddit, you don't join the Minecraft server, you just pop in discord. This explains why the MC server's activity goes down as the discord activity goes up. We are, afterall, a community. A chat reserved for us to talk and interact is perfect.\n\n---\n\n_Part 2: Deterioration of the server. Hovertal is gone for one, so that absolutely sucks. I missed that._\n\nPeople complained about Hovertal because nobody used it anymore. It just spammed the chat and it became useless. If people want it back, I'll add it, but I too felt like it was dead weight - same as marriage.\n\n---\n\n_The server is also completely piled with griefs. I'm serious. Just go to spawn, check it out! It's a gallery of griefs! There seems to be nothing new happening, either._\n\nPeople are welcome and encouraged to report griefs to #request-staff-help. If nobody complains, sometimes it's hard to fix things you think are fine. We rollback any and all griefs people tell us that have happened, and unless we happened to forgot, that's what's happened and will happen.\n\n---\n\n_I heard Sven was adding a roller coaster plugin: something he's just pulled from the shelf of Spigot, no doubt. Sounds really special, doesn't it? Instead of a cool plugin made just for us, it's just... there. Equal to any other plugin._\n\nSven says he's been coding it with a friend. It's always been his project and that is where the \"WHERE'S COASTER BUILDER\" meme came from. Sven has always worked on it and never finished it, no doubt a lot of times not working on it.\n\nBut this has happened since your time and Chris' time. Sven announcing projects that don't come or turn up not to be the same as he advertised. Everyone knows this, and yes it is a valid point, it's not a product of the \"new freddit\".\n\n---\n\n_Zoo. I'd consider Zoo the 'community owner'. That is NOT a bad thing. He monitors the community and deals with most drama situations. This is all fine, but... He's letting the server deteriorate. He's not focusing on it. He's also not all that active in my experience, but I might just think that due to our timezones._\n\nDuring these past weeks, I've been invisible on Discord. I used never to do that, which is a part of the reason why you probably think I'm not there when I am.\n\nI played on the MC server yesterday and on sunday  with some people. I won't lie saying I'm not as active as I was during summer, I'm definetly more inactive and you are right when you say I'm not that active.\n\nI've expressed these things in a rant a week ago in #venting where I even went to the point of offering my resignation if people felt like I should be demoted and I shouldn't be trusted with owner anymore. Most people said I should be kept as owner even if I am not as active anymore.\n\nYou did say that it could be due to our timezone differences, and yes that's another factor, along with the \"always invisible\" and \"im more inactive than i used to be due to school work\". However, I don't feel like I'm letting the server \"deteriorate\".\n\nPlugins don't cultivate interest as much as they used to. They don't have the player boost effect you think they do, because it's a fact that people on Freddit don't play MC Freddit that much anymore. But as I said, your point is valid and although there's reasons why the server feels more deteriorated, there's room for improvement and I will be on the look out for fun plugins.\n\nSven launched a feedback poll to get the sense of some new stuff coming up and people's reactions. We've discussed this, including the new rank, a proposed rank reset by Sven and other things.\n\n---\n\n_... He also seems to be restricted from doing anything else-- if he makes a community decision, all of staff backlash instantly._\n\n(About sven); This part was weird. Sven's new additions that get removed are the ones the community doesn't like. The backlash you talk about is true, a lot of backlash happens when sven suggested, for example:\n\nResetting everyone's ranks, unbanning Waving on Minecraft for no reason other than he's been waiting for too long, giving an idea that ranks should be pay-to-get, and also faking some \"emergencies\" and \"threats\" for the giggles.\n\nHe also suggests a lot of cool shit, like coasterbuilder, survival, other really fun stuff he has brainstormed with us. And we've liked it. There's stuff people like, and stuff people don't like.\n\nI don't think it's fair to exempt Sven from criticism and to say he should be able to add anything he pleases because he has a userbase to look out for, and Sven understands this, for the most part.\n\nWhen people disagree with his additions, most of the time he gives up on them. That takes dedication to this community. Yes sometimes he still goes through it and then cancells it after the backlash, but at least he listens to the criticism and embraces it.\n\nThis is one of the points you made I think shouldn't be accounted for. My and Sven's decisions should be questioned by the community. This is not a dictatorship where we do whatever we please, our additions are to contribute to the server, if they do the opposite, they should be shut down, whether it's mine or sven's idea.\n\n---\n\nAnd then this segment, which is a bit sad how you've claimed no staff at all do their jobs right. This is just blatantly false. Your exposure to their work is reduced significantly so I don't blame you for thinking it, afterall you were used to seeing them work in #staff.\n\nWe discuss and talk and suggest shit in #staff. The product of the MC server not being as active results in Staff not being as active in MC. It's cause and effect. This doesn't mean they're not serving the community well.\n\nI've seen staff members more active than anyone. Only Leaf, Zach and some other regulars level their activity on the discord. On public discord? No, some of the staff aren't as active. On #staff? They're as active and some are more active than the rest of the people.\n\n---\n\n_Part 4: Expanding the server. Users who come don't stay. They're asked 'are you new?' by staff a few times, and then they leave, never to be seen again. The server is not welcoming to new players, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay._\n\nBarely anyone cares about FNAF compared to how people cared about it. [This is google trend search for \"fnaf\".](https://imgur.com/Dc6QAwL).\n\nIt's been decreasing ever since. This is why players dont come as often as they used to. Why join the FNAF MC server when FNAF is barely relevant? Which is another reason why Freddit isn't focused to FNAF that much anymore.\n\n_Part 5: 'Sexual' moments._\n\nAgreed on most part. I think we should enforce and constrain this more. Yesterday a poll was made to dictate Spurr's second ban for this offense. We know about this and we are working on it.\n\n---\n\n_Part 6: There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I've been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can't really decide if I really could leave. It's sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was Admin for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Freddit time. Everything was active, things were good. and the drama hadn't really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don't know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don't see it coming back, so I don't really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now._\n\nThis is up to you. If you think Freddit isn't as exciting anymore, that's totally fine and you're welcome to leave. You're a great dude who did some stupid shit in the past. I'll miss you and most of your shitposts and memes. Yes I said most don't go spam me with yee haw pleas\n\n---\n\nAnyways, response over. \n\n**tldr mc server isnt as active due to decrease in interest in minecraft and fnaf, which leads to less new players and to more activity on discord instead of mc, which leads to staff working more on discord (#staff) instead of mc leading to people not seeing their work**\n\n&lt;/response&gt;",

It&amp;#39;s always been his project and that is where the &amp;quot;WHERE&amp;#39;S COASTER BUILDER&amp;quot; meme came from. Sven has always worked on it and never finished it, no doubt a lot of times not working on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this has happened since your time and Chris&amp;#39; time. Sven announcing projects that don&amp;#39;t come or turn up not to be the same as he advertised. Everyone knows this, and yes it is a valid point, it&amp;#39;s not a product of the &amp;quot;new freddit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoo. I&amp;#39;d consider Zoo the &amp;#39;community owner&amp;#39;. That is NOT a bad thing. He monitors the community and deals with most drama situations. This is all fine, but... He&amp;#39;s letting the server deteriorate. He&amp;#39;s not focusing on it. He&amp;#39;s also not all that active in my experience, but I might just think that due to our timezones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these past weeks, I&amp;#39;ve been invisible on Discord. I used never to do that, which is a part of the reason why you probably think I&amp;#39;m not there when I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I played on the MC server yesterday and on sunday  with some people. I won&amp;#39;t lie saying I&amp;#39;m not as active as I was during summer, I&amp;#39;m definetly more inactive and you are right when you say I&amp;#39;m not that active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve expressed these things in a rant a week ago in #venting where I even went to the point of offering my resignation if people felt like I should be demoted and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be trusted with owner anymore. Most people said I should be kept as owner even if I am not as active anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did say that it could be due to our timezone differences, and yes that&amp;#39;s another factor, along with the &amp;quot;always invisible&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;im more inactive than i used to be due to school work&amp;quot;. However, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m letting the server &amp;quot;deteriorate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plugins don&amp;#39;t cultivate interest as much as they used to. They don&amp;#39;t have the player boost effect you think they do, because it&amp;#39;s a fact that people on Freddit don&amp;#39;t play MC Freddit that much anymore. But as I said, your point is valid and although there&amp;#39;s reasons why the server feels more deteriorated, there&amp;#39;s room for improvement and I will be on the look out for fun plugins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sven launched a feedback poll to get the sense of some new stuff coming up and people&amp;#39;s reactions. We&amp;#39;ve discussed this, including the new rank, a proposed rank reset by Sven and other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;... He also seems to be restricted from doing anything else-- if he makes a community decision, all of staff backlash instantly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(About sven); This part was weird. Sven&amp;#39;s new additions that get removed are the ones the community doesn&amp;#39;t like. The backlash you talk about is true, a lot of backlash happens when sven suggested, for example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resetting everyone&amp;#39;s ranks, unbanning Waving on Minecraft for no reason other than he&amp;#39;s been waiting for too long, giving an idea that ranks should be pay-to-get, and also faking some &amp;quot;emergencies&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;threats&amp;quot; for the giggles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also suggests a lot of cool shit, like coasterbuilder, survival, other really fun stuff he has brainstormed with us. And we&amp;#39;ve liked it. There&amp;#39;s stuff people like, and stuff people don&amp;#39;t like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to exempt Sven from criticism and to say he should be able to add anything he pleases because he has a userbase to look out for, and Sven understands this, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people disagree with his additions, most of the time he gives up on them. That takes dedication to this community. Yes sometimes he still goes through it and then cancells it after the backlash, but at least he listens to the criticism and embraces it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is one of the points you made I think shouldn&amp;#39;t be accounted for. My and Sven&amp;#39;s decisions should be questioned by the community. This is not a dictatorship where we do whatever we please, our additions are to contribute to the server, if they do the opposite, they should be shut down, whether it&amp;#39;s mine or sven&amp;#39;s idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then this segment, which is a bit sad how you&amp;#39;ve claimed no staff at all do their jobs right. This is just blatantly false. Your exposure to their work is reduced significantly so I don&amp;#39;t blame you for thinking it, afterall you were used to seeing them work in #staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We discuss and talk and suggest shit in #staff. The product of the MC server not being as active results in Staff not being as active in MC. It&amp;#39;s cause and effect. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re not serving the community well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen staff members more active than anyone. Only Leaf, Zach and some other regulars level their activity on the discord. On public discord? No, some of the staff aren&amp;#39;t as active. On #staff? They&amp;#39;re as active and some are more active than the rest of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 4: Expanding the server. Users who come don&amp;#39;t stay. They&amp;#39;re asked &amp;#39;are you new?&amp;#39; by staff a few times, and then they leave, never to be seen again. The server is not welcoming to new players, and there is nothing that makes them interested to stay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barely anyone cares about FNAF compared to how people cared about it. &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/Dc6QAwL\"&gt;This is google trend search for &amp;quot;fnaf&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been decreasing ever since. This is why players dont come as often as they used to. Why join the FNAF MC server when FNAF is barely relevant? Which is another reason why Freddit isn&amp;#39;t focused to FNAF that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 5: &amp;#39;Sexual&amp;#39; moments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agreed on most part. I think we should enforce and constrain this more. Yesterday a poll was made to dictate Spurr&amp;#39;s second ban for this offense. We know about this and we are working on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 6: There are a few more personal reasons I want to leave too. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about these things for a long time, but I still can&amp;#39;t really decide if I really could leave. It&amp;#39;s sometimes the hope that things can go back to how they were in the early times, especially when I was Admin for the first time... after the elections, of course. That was probably my sweet-spot for actual being-on-Freddit time. Everything was active, things were good. and the drama hadn&amp;#39;t really ramped up to the level it did soon after. I don&amp;#39;t know if that time is ever gonna come back, though. I don&amp;#39;t see it coming back, so I don&amp;#39;t really know if I should stay, especially with how things are now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is up to you. If you think Freddit isn&amp;#39;t as exciting anymore, that&amp;#39;s totally fine and you&amp;#39;re welcome to leave. You&amp;#39;re a great dude who did some stupid shit in the past. I&amp;#39;ll miss you and most of your shitposts and memes. Yes I said most don&amp;#39;t go spam me with yee haw pleas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, response over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr mc server isnt as active due to decrease in interest in minecraft and fnaf, which leads to less new players and to more activity on discord instead of mc, which leads to staff working more on discord (#staff) instead of mc leading to people not seeing their work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/response&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
