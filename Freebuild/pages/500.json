This made me change my perspective from \"JAFC being confused and being persuaded into doing something really bad\" to \"JAFC actually just wanted to fuck with the whole server, including fucking up the bot, crashing the server, advertising RR on an infinite loop\".\n\nGod damn. It seems JAFC wasn't panicking out because he didn't know what to do, he spent countless time plotting the stuff (http://imgur.com/a/rMYFQ).\n\nUnbanning JAFC &amp; Psy, under the light of these new logs and knowing their intent was to harm the server and wasn't just some emotional weight that just blew up, is extremely unlikely.\n\nWhen I mean extremely unlikely is we aren't going to unban you two. If we are, it's because of an emmergency or we forgot all the things you've done to us. And we won't forget that anytime soon.\n\nAnyways, we have the worlds and the schematics JAFC, thankfully, gave us, and the server might be offline until tomorrow.\n\nThank you for choosing T.B.C. in your daily needs, from NSA espionage to health and care!\n\nThink less, buy more!\n\n- ~ Zoo Man",

This made me change my perspective from &amp;quot;JAFC being confused and being persuaded into doing something really bad&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;JAFC actually just wanted to fuck with the whole server, including fucking up the bot, crashing the server, advertising RR on an infinite loop&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God damn. It seems JAFC wasn&amp;#39;t panicking out because he didn&amp;#39;t know what to do, he spent countless time plotting the stuff (&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/rMYFQ\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/rMYFQ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbanning JAFC &amp;amp; Psy, under the light of these new logs and knowing their intent was to harm the server and wasn&amp;#39;t just some emotional weight that just blew up, is extremely unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I mean extremely unlikely is we aren&amp;#39;t going to unban you two. If we are, it&amp;#39;s because of an emmergency or we forgot all the things you&amp;#39;ve done to us. And we won&amp;#39;t forget that anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we have the worlds and the schematics JAFC, thankfully, gave us, and the server might be offline until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for choosing T.B.C. in your daily needs, from NSA espionage to health and care!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think less, buy more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;~ Zoo Man&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

And most people are probably wondering why would JAFC do such a thing.\n\n**JAFC had lost OP**, for causing a bunch of drama on the discord. After that, he kept on pushing and kept being salty due to that fact, so he got tempbanned for a day.\n\nBut that's not the end of the story! Before he got tempbanned for a day, some users were disrespecting him and calling him names. **T.B.C. does not accept these actions and has made an official post on #news of the Discord, even before the takeovers happened**. But JAFC apparently snapped, and with Waving pushing him towards doing things for his own bidding, JAFC asked Psy to get unbanned.\n\nAfter being unbanned by Psy, he started deleting worlds. A bunch of people's works, including innocent people, got erased permanently. Countless people that had shitty lives outside of Freddit, some real SHIT that has happened to them, and they came on Freddit as a safe place from all their shit, to build and make friends. \n\nAll that gone. We joke about this being just legos, and it is legos, but it's still a place where people hide from their problems in their lives, and all that just got smashed for... For some insults by some people, everyone got their works deleted, but only a small fraction of those ever did anything to JAFC.\n\nAnyways, Psy &amp; JAFC are both permanent banned. We have suspicions that JAFC got manipulated by Waving.\n\n---\n\n#But fear not!\n\nThe engineers and masterminds at T.B.C. have come up with one humdinger of a plan! Besides permanently banning JAFC, Psy, and Waving, with no chance of appeal (maaaybe for Psy, but that's stretching), that is!\n\nThe plan, codename being **DEFCON -1**, is being put into place as I write this post. The Broccoli Company will ensure that Freddit will prevail, and we are doing our best efforts to get back what is ours, the worlds and the files!\n\n**Warning**: We are not responsible for any actions of an independent person might do. If person X decides to come to Waving/JAFC's house and murder them, T.B.C. &amp; it's global CEO are not responsible for his actions.\n\nOur plan is just talking with them to get back our files. Anything else someone else does is not of our own responsibility.\n\n---\n\nAlright folks, that's a wrap up! Thank you  for reading this T.B.C. Post-Fallout Server Announcement, and we hope Freddit will succeed and finally have it's peace, away from RR! And never forget...\n\n**T.B.C. is the BEST for LESS!** Worry less, buy more!\n\n~ Zoo Man\n\n**EDIT**: T.B.C. LABS GOT DELETED? OHOHOHOH DEFCON -2 IT IS",

He's intending on deleting deepworld, but has a copy apparently.](http://i.imgur.com/mIEN1I7.png) \n\nPsy was the only other user online at the time of my initial ban and he's an opped staff member. He told me to contact jafc over Discord multiple times before he told me about his takeover (http://i.imgur.com/dydefJR.png). I logged in with another user's account that I had the login details to and Psy and JAFC were the only  ones online. They're working together.  \n\n**UPDATE:** [He's deleting worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/8NvWEU8.png)\n\n[He's doing a takeover and is panicking about it. But why do it then, Jafc? Why why WHY](http://i.imgur.com/GSs3qd7.png)\n\n[He has a motive, but wants to \"finish this\" before telling it.](http://i.imgur.com/f0KLBfR.png)\n\n**UPDATE:** [His motive.](http://i.imgur.com/hOTla46.png) I agree that it's basically bullying most of the time and that a lot of people have a biased grudge towards him, but a TAKEOVER?\n\n**UPDATE:** http://i.imgur.com/gbwOMNQ.png\n\nEntire worlds are gone. Users who had no involvement with Jafc whatsoever. Everything everyone's worked so hard for is gone.\n\nGood job, Jafc. You wanted to stop the hate, but you just amplified it for yourself. And Psy, you lost trust.\n\n**FINAL UPDATE FOR NOW:** I asked JAFC to unban me. He did so, and I permabanned him and Psy as soon as I got on the server. I'm unbanning everyone who JAFC unbanned. We have a copy of the city from at least a month ago (/warp rpregion for that), but the other worlds are gone. \n___\n\n#BASIC TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED:  \n* Psy and I are the only ones online.  \n* Psy tells me to talk to Jafc over Discord.  \n* I'm banned out of nowhere. Jafc tells me in pms that he's taking over.  \n* **LIKELY:** Psy unbans and ops Jafc. \n* Jafc warns me in pms that he's deleting worlds.  \n* PANIC IN FREDDITCHAT WOO WOO WOO DEFCON 0 WOO WOO WOO  \n* Jafc tells everyone in pms that he has a motive, but wants to \"finish the job\".  \n* Several users attempt to log in, but are banned immediately.  \n* Jafc reveals that he was getting tired of Dedi and Woger's hate and that nobody listened to him, so he did a takeover as vengeance or something. He himself is panicking and doesn't know what to do.  \n* Psy is the only user other than Jafc to stay online. He's not responding to Discord messages and went offline on Discord. It's pretty evident that they conspired in this takeover.  \n* The worlds are gone by now.  \n* I ask Jafc to unban me in Discord pms, he does so. I ban him and Psy as soon as I log on again.  \n\nTl;dr Jafc and Psy conspired to take revenge on the server by deleting worlds containing many, many builds of innocent users and it can't be undone unless someone magically shows up with world files.

He told me to contact jafc over Discord multiple times before he told me about his takeover (&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/dydefJR.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/dydefJR.png&lt;/a&gt;).

Why why WHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/f0KLBfR.png\"&gt;He has a motive, but wants to &amp;quot;finish this&amp;quot; before telling it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/hOTla46.png\"&gt;His motive.&lt;/a&gt; I agree that it&amp;#39;s basically bullying most of the time and that a lot of people have a biased grudge towards him, but a TAKEOVER?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gbwOMNQ.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/gbwOMNQ.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Entire worlds are gone. Users who had no involvement with Jafc whatsoever. Everything everyone&amp;#39;s worked so hard for is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good job, Jafc. You wanted to stop the hate, but you just amplified it for yourself. And Psy, you lost trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL UPDATE FOR NOW:&lt;/strong&gt; I asked JAFC to unban me. He did so, and I permabanned him and Psy as soon as I got on the server. I&amp;#39;m unbanning everyone who JAFC unbanned. We have a copy of the city from at least a month ago (/warp rpregion for that), but the other worlds are gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;BASIC TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Psy and I are the only ones online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Psy tells me to talk to Jafc over Discord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m banned out of nowhere. Jafc tells me in pms that he&amp;#39;s taking over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKELY:&lt;/strong&gt; Psy unbans and ops Jafc. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jafc warns me in pms that he&amp;#39;s deleting worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PANIC IN FREDDITCHAT WOO WOO WOO DEFCON 0 WOO WOO WOO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jafc tells everyone in pms that he has a motive, but wants to &amp;quot;finish the job&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Several users attempt to log in, but are banned immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jafc reveals that he was getting tired of Dedi and Woger&amp;#39;s hate and that nobody listened to him, so he did a takeover as vengeance or something. He himself is panicking and doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Psy is the only user other than Jafc to stay online. He&amp;#39;s not responding to Discord messages and went offline on Discord. It&amp;#39;s pretty evident that they conspired in this takeover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The worlds are gone by now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I ask Jafc to unban me in Discord pms, he does so. I ban him and Psy as soon as I log on again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr Jafc and Psy conspired to take revenge on the server by deleting worlds containing many, many builds of innocent users and it can&amp;#39;t be undone unless someone magically shows up with world files. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Haven't I heard this before?\" but before you get mad and hop over to the comments section hear me out.\n\n\n\nA bunch of users, usually staff, constantly disrespects me, barrages on me, etc. (Dedi, and Woger being the main offenders of this)\nI tell Zoo that people are doing this and he says I'm wrong and starts going on about how I need to change. Maybe I'm not the one who needed change, but they did. Even when they DO do 'something', it's not much more then a pat on the head and a \"don't do it again.\" But they do do it again. And Zoo doesn't care. It makes me very very very mad, and this happens all the time, day in and day out. Even when I just try to state my opinion or state facts \"Why can Zen return to being Owner just because you forgot to change their PEX rank?\" is apparently lying about staff and is worth being punished. Bullshit.\n\n\n\nI'm also treated **unfairly.** [Even Sven said that himself!](http://prntscr.com/elwchm) Bad 'Reputation'? Really? Calling Woger out for what she did also was a 'shitty thing to do' according to Zoo. Not to mention, even after Woger constantly disrespects me, she gets a custom rank! But me? No. Zoo did everything in his power to ensure I *wouldn't have gotten one.* Once again showing that I am treated unfairly.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why I did it. I hoped something would change but it didn't. Nobody even tried to do anything about it. Nothing was going to change. I know what I did was wrong and irredeemable, but everybody thought I was evil takeover man anyway, so I guess I'm proving you right. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n\nNot everyone did anything wrong to me, and I'm sorry if your build is gone now. I understand if anyone hates me for this. I don't expect to be unbanned or anything in the near future-- if ever. By the time I was doubting about doing this, it was already too late.\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm sorry to those who did nothing wrong to me and didn't deserve this. I really am. But I wanted to show that I didn't do this nonsense with no reason at all.\n\n\n\nthank you for reading\n",

Even when they DO do &amp;#39;something&amp;#39;, it&amp;#39;s not much more then a pat on the head and a &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t do it again.&amp;quot; But they do do it again. And Zoo doesn&amp;#39;t care. It makes me very very very mad, and this happens all the time, day in and day out. Even when I just try to state my opinion or state facts &amp;quot;Why can Zen return to being Owner just because you forgot to change their PEX rank?&amp;quot; is apparently lying about staff and is worth being punished. Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also treated &lt;strong&gt;unfairly.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://prntscr.com/elwchm\"&gt;Even Sven said that himself!&lt;/a&gt; Bad &amp;#39;Reputation&amp;#39;? Really? Calling Woger out for what she did also was a &amp;#39;shitty thing to do&amp;#39; according to Zoo. Not to mention, even after Woger constantly disrespects me, she gets a custom rank! But me? No. Zoo did everything in his power to ensure I &lt;em&gt;wouldn&amp;#39;t have gotten one.&lt;/em&gt; Once again showing that I am treated unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s why I did it. I hoped something would change but it didn&amp;#39;t. Nobody even tried to do anything about it. Nothing was going to change. I know what I did was wrong and irredeemable, but everybody thought I was evil takeover man anyway, so I guess I&amp;#39;m proving you right. \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone did anything wrong to me, and I&amp;#39;m sorry if your build is gone now. I understand if anyone hates me for this. I don&amp;#39;t expect to be unbanned or anything in the near future-- if ever. By the time I was doubting about doing this, it was already too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I&amp;#39;m sorry to those who did nothing wrong to me and didn&amp;#39;t deserve this. I really am. But I wanted to show that I didn&amp;#39;t do this nonsense with no reason at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thank you for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He will still have to follow Staff's order, if needed be. He cannot break any Server rules to punish someone who broke RPCity rules.\n\n---\n\n#What the role of RPCity Mayor will be\n\nHe will be the go-to guy for RPCity related questions. If you want to build in RPCity, you ask the Mayor. If you have suggestions for RPCity, you ask the Mayor. If something happened to your build in RPCity, you go to the Mayor, which in turn, if there was a grief that he didn't approve, will go to Staff.\n\n#RPCity rules\n\nRPCity rules will be assembled by the Staff. The RPCity Mayor will have to enforce these rules in order to, for example, explain why a build was moved.\n\n**The RPCity Mayor cannot abuse his power.** If he removed your build and it wasn't against the RPCity rules, you have a right to come to Staff and tell us about it.\n\n#Custom Prefix\n\nThe RPCity Mayor will have his own Custom Prefix indicating he's the Mayor. He will also have a discord rank. \n\n#The RPCity Mayor will have OP.\n\nHe cannot abuse it, though, or use it for other purpouses other than RPCity related business.\n\n#RPCity Mayor's responsibilities\n\nTo take care of RPCity and keep it organized, well-running, and the people who participate in it well-treated.\n\nHe must **always** warn someone before he does something to their build. If it's someone who is really inactive, he'll have to talk to Staff about it prior to the decision.\n\n#RPCity Subreddit &amp; Discord\n\nFor all the rules of RPCity, for doubts about certain things in RPCity, for events, you go to the RPCity discord or the subreddit. \n\n#The infrastructure-functionalities of RPCity will be built by the Mayor.\n\nWhat I mean is, he can assemble a counsil, for example, to help him. He can modify the rules of RPCity (he will have to ask Staff first and he will have to have the RPCity builders' interest as the top priority), he can modify the CSS of the sub, he can modify the discord, even make a banner and shit.\n\nPeople can also suggest stuff to the Mayor, he can set up a poll (to see what the RPCity community thinks) and then do the changes.\n\n---\n\n**The RPCity Mayor won't be permanent, unless everyone is fine with it**. There will be more than one election, and depending on the Mayor's job, it can be soon or in the future.\n\n---\n\n#APPLY FOR RPCITY MAYOR HERE!\n\nJust comment down below:\n\n- **Username:**\n\n- **Rank:**\n\n- **Contributions to RPCity you've done**:\n\n- **Do you already have plans? If yes, what those might be?**:\n\n- **Why you want to be the Mayor**:\n\n---\n\nAfter a while of Applications we will have a poll in which people will be able to vote for the Mayor.\n\nThat's all for now, and make sure to apply for the Mayor!",

Woo, wee. It says it all. I became a \"joke\", a person people mock.  \nOh wait, isn't that shit bullying? Well... technically... yeah. It sure fucking is. How is it bullying? It attacks my person, my image, whatever it's fucking called.  \n  \nBut wait, is that all? Fuck no. Just now, joined the server right, had to talk for five minutes (of course, I joked by advertising RR, because of you guys pissing me the fuck off), and what do we have?  \n\\&gt; broadcast leaks where I live (**RESPECT YOUR OWN FUCKING RULES**)  \n[18] Don't leak any private information about anyone and don't stalk anyone or try to find someone's private information (irl or cyber) on purpouse.\nYeah, that's fucking right, that's what you fuckers did. Sure fucking feels good to be a creepy fucking asshole, hoaxing people. Doesn't it?  \nYou must feel **SO GOOD** about yourself. So, fucking, good. But hey, would that be all? No.  \n  \nYou know what's hilarious? All the shit you've given me the past months, all the \"it's not your files\" and all the \"nobody cares\" and all the \"you're the bad guy\". Would I ever do the shit you did? No, fucking, way.  \nYou see, there is a line in what's OK and not OK, and you fuckers broke the line hard. It's not even a damn line anymore, it's dust. Goddamn dust.  \n  \nNow let's talk about it, would I want to be unbanned from a server that does organized bullying? Fuck no. Not only that. But guess who's always blamed when shit happens to Freddit?  \nMotherfucking me, why? Because you guys are fucking assholes and you should honestly be ashamed of yourselves for all the shit you've given me.  \n  \nThat's it for now.

Well RIP freddit it was a good run\" or \"Ass is here? Welp im out\" or \"Oh ass the annoying cunt is here\" or shit like that) will be punished for trying to start shit with him.\n\n- He'll be on User rank, it will be an entire fresh start for him.\n\nThe last thing I ask of the community is to give him a chance. He says he's sorry, and he apologized, and even if you don't believe his apology, I ask you to give him a chance.\n\nWe've all done some shit we aren't proud of. I'm included, everyone here is included. But just because you fuck up once, doesn't mean you'll keep fucking up all the time (except for a few cases that have consistently kept fucking up). So, just as we all been given chances by everyone else and forgiven, I ask of you to also give Ass a chance to show that he has changed (don't forget if he hasn't changed and he keeps starting shit, he'll be banned again.).\n\nEven if you don't forgive him, or if you still dislike him for the stuff he does, don't start anything with him. That's all I'm asking of you right now. A little compassion and forgiveness. Afterall, this is his first chance after his unban.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n~ Zoo Man",
