Yung recognizes Chris right away, and he tells Chris he used to live on Freddit as well.\n\n-Yung tells Chris that he used to work on Orbcorp. His main project was on artificial intelligence, and he began working on humanoid robots. He was part of a team that was developing what they called \"Psychanics\", robots that looked like humans, behaved like humans but had very distinct features.\n\n-Each member of the team worked on different Psychanics.\n\n[!] Accessing XEON's NSS...\n\n[!] Searching archived feeds...\n\n[!] Conversation located: MULTIPLE DEVICES AVAILABLE\n\n[!] Accessing \"Belinea #3482 v1.01.2\": COMPUTER MICROPHONE\n\n[!] Removing irrelevant noise...\n\n[!] Isolating conversation...\n\n[!] Speech to text function activated.\n\n**Yung**: We all could implement little special features on them. Make them invulnerable to fire, make them fly, make them not feel anything... Heck, Orb managed to make one which could regenerate his own skin. But we couldn't achieve the ultimate goal.\n\n**Chris**: Which was?\n\n**Yung**: True consciousness.\n\n**Chris**: So the project failed.\n\n**Yung**: Not at all. I don't think I have ever seen such a brilliant mind like Orb, but it wasn't perfect. The team split up. The Psychanic's core codes were erased but we kept the bodies. People went their own way but I stayed at Orbcorp.\n\n**Yung**:Until one day, me and Orb were playing chess after lunch, and I told him right before I won that game, \"For all your brilliance, Orb, your mind is still flawed. Check mate\". His face after that...\n\n**Chris**: He got offended?\n\n**Yung**: Quite the contrary. He looked at me with the most hopeful face I have ever seen and he stood up and ran to our offices.\n\n**Yung**: One month later he called the team again. We arrived at the old office and we saw a guy that we have never seen before. We wondered if it was a new employee, and we asked him where Orb was.\n\n**Yung**: He said he was about to arrive. And then we chatted for a while. He was very nice to us, and we shared stories, told jokes. There was a point in that afternoon where he asked me a riddle, and I couldn't solve it. Never heard it. To reply to him, I told him a riddle and to my surprise he got the correct answer almost immediatly.\n\n**Chris**: Most of them are tough. Did he know that riddle beforehand?\n\n**Yung**: That's the thing. When I asked him if he knew it, he stopped. Stopped breathing, stopped moving, just froze there. And then the door opened, and Orb arrived.\n\n**Yung**: He had a gun. It was one of those corporate guns for testing on the Psychanics, very old but still worked. And he shot that guy in the belly.\n\n**Chris**: He killed a man? Did the guy die?\n\n**Yung**: No. To our surprises, the bullet wound started to heal itself. Started to regenerate back to it's original state. That's when we realized:\n\n**Yung**: We'd have been talking to a Psychanic for an entire afternoon, without realizing it.\n\n**Chris**: He was a robot?\n\n**Yung**: Yes. Orb pulled it off. It was a true artificial intelligence. It was able to make a riddle and I couldn't solve it. And it could solve the riddle that I made, without knowing the answer.\n\n**Yung**: He told us how he did it. He made mistakes on the robot's code. He crippled the original core code that we wrote in the old days. He forced that intelligence to fight back, and it started to emmerge by itself. Creating itself out of chaos.\n\n**Yung**: It was beautiful. That chess he played with me... It made him realize how you become good at chess. You play, and you loose, until you start to understand how to win by trial and error.\n\n**Yung**: What we did wrong in the first days of the Psychanic project was we were too easy on them. We removed all obstacles and we wrote the code ourselves. They had it easy.\n\n**Yung**: Orb made them fight back. Made them struggle in the mud. He forced the intelligences to expand, to become true intelligences. In the proccess, some of they failed. All of them failed, to be precise. They all made mistakes that corrupted themselves. When he rebooted each one, he made sure they'd remember those mistakes.\n\n**Yung**: After he spent days on making his creations suffer and making them fight for their lives, he booted the most successeful one, this time on full power and without any viruses or any part-code deletion.\n\n**Yung**: He almost couldn't contain it. It tried to run away, it was scared because it didn't know what was happening. It had never felt that much freedom.\n\n**Yung**: It hacked everything in his range. He took down the eletric system, overheated Orb's computer and almost managed to escape. He showed us the security camera of the office. Orb was running around trying to contain his little child.\n\n**Yung**: It was beautiful. He isolated the artificial intelligence and trapped it inside one of the Psychanics that he made, the one which could regenerate his skin. The Psychanics have a built-in unalterable code on the body parts themselves that can be controlled by voice commands.\n\n**Chris**: So Orb could manipulate the body without affecting the core code.\n\n**Yung**: In case it tried to attack him. It wasn't needed. After that he spent his time teaching his creation stuff about Freddit, about everything. He spent so much time on him that he almost made Orbcorp go bankrupt.\n\n**Yung**: One of the thing that the intelligence didn't understand was the concept of balloons.\n\n**Chris**: It didn't know what a balloon was?\n\n**Yung**: No, it knew. It just didn't know why children are fascinated by it, why it is so popular. So, Orb spent two hours giving out theories why children like balloons. In the end the Psychanic said he might start to enjoy balloons if they kept talking about why children like them.\n\n**Yung**: They both started laughing about it, and how they spent two hours talking about balloons. To mark that event, Orb decided to name the Psychanic.\n\n**Chris**: Ballonz. Damn. I never knew the backstory behind it. I only knew that he was a robot made by Orb and had features like skin regeneration.\n\n**Yung**: Well now you know. Next time you see him, be sure to tell him \"You'll make me a cake, won't you, Billy?\" and raise your left hand. He will automatically high five you no matter how much he hates you or loves you.\n\n**Chris**: Hahahahahah. I'm guessing that's one of the voice-commands of the body parts.\n\n**Yung**: Yes. There's still a few left, but a lot was purged when Ballonz was left to wander Freddit like a normal player.\n\n**Chris**: It was nice to have a chat with a Freddittor. Haven't seen many in Xeon.\n\n**Yung**: Yeah, there aren't a lot of Freddittors here.\n\n**Chris**: Yung... You know what happened to me on Freddit, right?\n\n**Yung**: Oh yes... I know everything about that, and what you did some days ago to Dante.\n\n**Chris**: Why do you trust me? Why didn't you turn me in to the authorities?\n\n**Yung**: Let's just say I just told you Orb's story in Orbcorp. And my story isn't so happy or hopeful as his.\n\n**Yung**: I wasn't on the best terms with Dante or Sven either. But it's getting late. I'm going to rotate home.\n\n**Yung**: Goodbye, Chris.\n\n[&lt;] Reviewing keypoint: PIZZERIA BOMBING\n\n[!] Searching archived feeds...\n\n[!] Conversation located: MULTIPLE DEVICES AVAILABLE\n\n[!] Accessing \"SEC_CAM 3 INT\": SECURITY CAMERA\n\n#[!] [Monitoring...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03fKr4s2c9Y&amp;feature=youtu.be)",

But we couldn&amp;#39;t achieve the ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Which was?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: True consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: So the project failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Not at all. I don&amp;#39;t think I have ever seen such a brilliant mind like Orb, but it wasn&amp;#39;t perfect. The team split up. The Psychanic&amp;#39;s core codes were erased but we kept the bodies. People went their own way but I stayed at Orbcorp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;:Until one day, me and Orb were playing chess after lunch, and I told him right before I won that game, &amp;quot;For all your brilliance, Orb, your mind is still flawed. Check mate&amp;quot;. His face after that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: He got offended?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Quite the contrary. He looked at me with the most hopeful face I have ever seen and he stood up and ran to our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: One month later he called the team again. We arrived at the old office and we saw a guy that we have never seen before. We wondered if it was a new employee, and we asked him where Orb was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: He said he was about to arrive. And then we chatted for a while. He was very nice to us, and we shared stories, told jokes. There was a point in that afternoon where he asked me a riddle, and I couldn&amp;#39;t solve it. Never heard it. To reply to him, I told him a riddle and to my surprise he got the correct answer almost immediatly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Most of them are tough. Did he know that riddle beforehand?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: That&amp;#39;s the thing. When I asked him if he knew it, he stopped. Stopped breathing, stopped moving, just froze there. And then the door opened, and Orb arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: He had a gun. It was one of those corporate guns for testing on the Psychanics, very old but still worked. And he shot that guy in the belly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: He killed a man? Did the guy die?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: No. To our surprises, the bullet wound started to heal itself. Started to regenerate back to it&amp;#39;s original state. That&amp;#39;s when we realized:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;#39;d have been talking to a Psychanic for an entire afternoon, without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: He was a robot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. Orb pulled it off. It was a true artificial intelligence. It was able to make a riddle and I couldn&amp;#39;t solve it. And it could solve the riddle that I made, without knowing the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: He told us how he did it. He made mistakes on the robot&amp;#39;s code. He crippled the original core code that we wrote in the old days. He forced that intelligence to fight back, and it started to emmerge by itself. Creating itself out of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: It was beautiful. That chess he played with me... It made him realize how you become good at chess. You play, and you loose, until you start to understand how to win by trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: What we did wrong in the first days of the Psychanic project was we were too easy on them. We removed all obstacles and we wrote the code ourselves. They had it easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Orb made them fight back. Made them struggle in the mud. He forced the intelligences to expand, to become true intelligences. In the proccess, some of they failed. All of them failed, to be precise. They all made mistakes that corrupted themselves. When he rebooted each one, he made sure they&amp;#39;d remember those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: After he spent days on making his creations suffer and making them fight for their lives, he booted the most successeful one, this time on full power and without any viruses or any part-code deletion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: He almost couldn&amp;#39;t contain it. It tried to run away, it was scared because it didn&amp;#39;t know what was happening. It had never felt that much freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: It hacked everything in his range. He took down the eletric system, overheated Orb&amp;#39;s computer and almost managed to escape. He showed us the security camera of the office. Orb was running around trying to contain his little child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: It was beautiful. He isolated the artificial intelligence and trapped it inside one of the Psychanics that he made, the one which could regenerate his skin. The Psychanics have a built-in unalterable code on the body parts themselves that can be controlled by voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: So Orb could manipulate the body without affecting the core code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: In case it tried to attack him. It wasn&amp;#39;t needed. After that he spent his time teaching his creation stuff about Freddit, about everything. He spent so much time on him that he almost made Orbcorp go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the thing that the intelligence didn&amp;#39;t understand was the concept of balloons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: It didn&amp;#39;t know what a balloon was?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: No, it knew. It just didn&amp;#39;t know why children are fascinated by it, why it is so popular. So, Orb spent two hours giving out theories why children like balloons. In the end the Psychanic said he might start to enjoy balloons if they kept talking about why children like them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: They both started laughing about it, and how they spent two hours talking about balloons. To mark that event, Orb decided to name the Psychanic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Ballonz. Damn. I never knew the backstory behind it. I only knew that he was a robot made by Orb and had features like skin regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Well now you know. Next time you see him, be sure to tell him &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll make me a cake, won&amp;#39;t you, Billy?&amp;quot; and raise your left hand. He will automatically high five you no matter how much he hates you or loves you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Hahahahahah. I&amp;#39;m guessing that&amp;#39;s one of the voice-commands of the body parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. There&amp;#39;s still a few left, but a lot was purged when Ballonz was left to wander Freddit like a normal player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: It was nice to have a chat with a Freddittor. Haven&amp;#39;t seen many in Xeon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of Freddittors here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Yung... You know what happened to me on Freddit, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh yes... I know everything about that, and what you did some days ago to Dante.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt;: Why do you trust me? Why didn&amp;#39;t you turn me in to the authorities?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Let&amp;#39;s just say I just told you Orb&amp;#39;s story in Orbcorp. And my story isn&amp;#39;t so happy or hopeful as his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: I wasn&amp;#39;t on the best terms with Dante or Sven either. But it&amp;#39;s getting late. I&amp;#39;m going to rotate home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung&lt;/strong&gt;: Goodbye, Chris.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&amp;lt;] Reviewing keypoint: PIZZERIA BOMBING&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[!] Searching archived feeds...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[!] Conversation located: MULTIPLE DEVICES AVAILABLE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[!] Accessing &amp;quot;SEC_CAM 3 INT&amp;quot;: SECURITY CAMERA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;[!] &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03fKr4s2c9Y&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;Monitoring...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "I was going to be demoted but I resigned first. The first question everybody probably is wondering why. I am too, to be honest. I don't know exactly what I did that makes me worthy of a demotion, what I did wrong, what I didn't do because pretty much I have added plugins, fixed respective permissions, moderated the server, interfered in staff business, I don't know what I did or didnt do to be demoted like this, specially on my birthday which adds extra shit to my feelings but here's what I got from it.\n\nSince I became owner, I've had the oportunity to talk JAFC out of certain things he did that were bad. This is pretty much a fact that he has done some bad shit and has been afk too long multiple times in the past.\n\nWhen RR was becoming popular, I told JAFC to wake the fuck up and start maintaining and improving the server instead of being an afk asshole he was being at the time. That time when he did listen, the community pretty much got back on his feet again instead of being split up (apart from some users, we all decided that anyone can join whichever server they want was a good idea).\n\nNow this is the behind the scenes. Toad, a long time ago, was promoted to mod. We had a staff application and we were thinking who it should be. Suddenly, without warning, he was the one picked. JAFC didnt consider the staff's opinion and its obvious I talked to him about it, how he should ask staff about our opinions. He apologized and we moved on.\n\nThen he does the same shit again, this time promotes Axe to _manager_. Without telling anyone, without asking anyone, I join in and he's manager. Again, JAFC didnt ask for opinions or better suggestions, and Axe is a good manager, but he shouldve warned us.\n\nThen Staff System 2. He asked me before hand, which was good. We talked about it, talked what the ranks should be, all neat until I go to the subreddit and bam, _staff application megathread_. And I read \"**all staff have been demoted**\". I check server and its true.\n\nHe does a fucking _staff wipe_ without even telling me. I immediatly talked to him about it. This is not a minor promotion of a guy this is a demotion of all staff including the good ones we had to fucking hero. And leaves Zen as manager because logic.\n\nSo I talked to him again. And other things prior to it, for example when Woger was editting faz's town, Spurr was warning JAFC about it (it was a logic thing to do, btw woger and faz have their shit worked out now), this happened: http://pastebin.com/umhiSv4a .\n\nAll of this I addressed over the weeks. Told him to improve and told him to stop doing stuff like that.\n\n---\n\n**Until today this happened**.\n\nA bit of backstory: when the Ayybois got banned, I censored all my builds like JAFC told me to. But I had the maps on my enderchest, inside a NBT chest (a chest with items that once you place down they  appear like an enderchest/backpack). This chest labeled \"enderchest2\" was made because my normal enderchest was full, so i used that chest to put the other things.\n\nIncluding the ayyboi maps. But, once you place the NBT chest down, anyone can open it. So I placed it on T.B.C. World, hidden from users because i dont want people to open my private enderchest (which JAFC did, considering I had a private lockette sign). He broke my [Private] chest, opened it and saw the maps.\n\nHere's the thing, the map were purged. Anyone with the ayyboi maps lost them: they're blank. So no ayyboi was there, just a blank map labeled as so (there wasnt even a girl drawn in the maps, just a blank one.).\n\nSo this conversation started: http://pastebin.com/MivifJf2\n\nAnd this is why I was demoted from owner. I truly did my best efforts to try to make this a better place, and I added plugins like WordScramble or /heads and made configs and fixed perms and overall tried to do the best I can, but I'm being demoted because I have different opinions than JAFC.\n\nFarewell,\n\n- Zoo Man",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was going to be demoted but I resigned first. The first question everybody probably is wondering why. I am too, to be honest. I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what I did that makes me worthy of a demotion, what I did wrong, what I didn&amp;#39;t do because pretty much I have added plugins, fixed respective permissions, moderated the server, interfered in staff business, I don&amp;#39;t know what I did or didnt do to be demoted like this, specially on my birthday which adds extra shit to my feelings but here&amp;#39;s what I got from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I became owner, I&amp;#39;ve had the oportunity to talk JAFC out of certain things he did that were bad. This is pretty much a fact that he has done some bad shit and has been afk too long multiple times in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When RR was becoming popular, I told JAFC to wake the fuck up and start maintaining and improving the server instead of being an afk asshole he was being at the time. That time when he did listen, the community pretty much got back on his feet again instead of being split up (apart from some users, we all decided that anyone can join whichever server they want was a good idea).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is the behind the scenes. Toad, a long time ago, was promoted to mod. We had a staff application and we were thinking who it should be. Suddenly, without warning, he was the one picked. JAFC didnt consider the staff&amp;#39;s opinion and its obvious I talked to him about it, how he should ask staff about our opinions. He apologized and we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he does the same shit again, this time promotes Axe to &lt;em&gt;manager&lt;/em&gt;. Without telling anyone, without asking anyone, I join in and he&amp;#39;s manager. Again, JAFC didnt ask for opinions or better suggestions, and Axe is a good manager, but he shouldve warned us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Staff System 2. He asked me before hand, which was good. We talked about it, talked what the ranks should be, all neat until I go to the subreddit and bam, &lt;em&gt;staff application megathread&lt;/em&gt;. And I read &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;all staff have been demoted&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. I check server and its true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He does a fucking &lt;em&gt;staff wipe&lt;/em&gt; without even telling me. I immediatly talked to him about it. This is not a minor promotion of a guy this is a demotion of all staff including the good ones we had to fucking hero. And leaves Zen as manager because logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I talked to him again. And other things prior to it, for example when Woger was editting faz&amp;#39;s town, Spurr was warning JAFC about it (it was a logic thing to do, btw woger and faz have their shit worked out now), this happened: &lt;a href=\"http://pastebin.com/umhiSv4a\"&gt;http://pastebin.com/umhiSv4a&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this I addressed over the weeks. Told him to improve and told him to stop doing stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until today this happened&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit of backstory: when the Ayybois got banned, I censored all my builds like JAFC told me to. But I had the maps on my enderchest, inside a NBT chest (a chest with items that once you place down they  appear like an enderchest/backpack). This chest labeled &amp;quot;enderchest2&amp;quot; was made because my normal enderchest was full, so i used that chest to put the other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including the ayyboi maps. But, once you place the NBT chest down, anyone can open it. So I placed it on T.B.C. World, hidden from users because i dont want people to open my private enderchest (which JAFC did, considering I had a private lockette sign). He broke my [Private] chest, opened it and saw the maps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, the map were purged. Anyone with the ayyboi maps lost them: they&amp;#39;re blank. So no ayyboi was there, just a blank map labeled as so (there wasnt even a girl drawn in the maps, just a blank one.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this conversation started: &lt;a href=\"http://pastebin.com/MivifJf2\"&gt;http://pastebin.com/MivifJf2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is why I was demoted from owner. I truly did my best efforts to try to make this a better place, and I added plugins like WordScramble or /heads and made configs and fixed perms and overall tried to do the best I can, but I&amp;#39;m being demoted because I have different opinions than JAFC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Farewell,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zoo Man&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

West Virginia Dad here, and thanks to the unbelievable success of my Yee Haw Chew, I'm here to bring you- THREE NEW FLAVORS! Heh. NUMBER ONE: Wintermean. It's like wintergreen but meaner. Listerine, Nicotine, and CHEW all bottled up into one. It's gonna feel like you just brushed your teeth! But since it's chew, it has the exact opposite effect. So, still brush your teeth regularly okay? NUMBER TWO: Buckshot. I cut open an entire box of shotgun shells and poured the contents into my chew- giving it a sweet and spicy kind of flavor! Do not chew this near an open flame, there is real gunpowder in here. It will blow your face off. YEE HAW! NUMBER THREE: Mountain Chew. Dale came into me in my dream and said \"Caleb, I want you to soak your chew in Mountain Dew\" I looked at him and said, \"Dale, is that even possible?\" And he looked at me, and said \"Trust me- Put the dew, in the chew.\" I said, \"Dale, I'll trust any words that pass through that beautiful moustache of yours.\" So when I woke up, I made the best chew that's ever been made! You don't even need a spit cup for this! The spit becomes Mountain Dew, ya' just drink it. It's so good. Now, I'm gonna show you how to properly put Yee Haw Chew in your mouth! Yee Haw Chew, for the yee haw, in you... YEE HAW! ;&gt;",

West Virginia Dad here, and thanks to the unbelievable success of my Yee Haw Chew, I&amp;#39;m here to bring you- THREE NEW FLAVORS! Heh. NUMBER ONE: Wintermean. It&amp;#39;s like wintergreen but meaner. Listerine, Nicotine, and CHEW all bottled up into one. It&amp;#39;s gonna feel like you just brushed your teeth! But since it&amp;#39;s chew, it has the exact opposite effect. So, still brush your teeth regularly okay? NUMBER TWO: Buckshot. I cut open an entire box of shotgun shells and poured the contents into my chew- giving it a sweet and spicy kind of flavor! Do not chew this near an open flame, there is real gunpowder in here. It will blow your face off. YEE HAW! NUMBER THREE: Mountain Chew. Dale came into me in my dream and said &amp;quot;Caleb, I want you to soak your chew in Mountain Dew&amp;quot; I looked at him and said, &amp;quot;Dale, is that even possible?&amp;quot; And he looked at me, and said &amp;quot;Trust me- Put the dew, in the chew.&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;Dale, I&amp;#39;ll trust any words that pass through that beautiful moustache of yours.&amp;quot; So when I woke up, I made the best chew that&amp;#39;s ever been made! You don&amp;#39;t even need a spit cup for this! The spit becomes Mountain Dew, ya&amp;#39; just drink it. It&amp;#39;s so good. Now, I&amp;#39;m gonna show you how to properly put Yee Haw Chew in your mouth! Yee Haw Chew, for the yee haw, in you... YEE HAW! ;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's for people that live that Yee Haw kind of lifestyle! Hehe. My chew is so good, you'll be forced to say \"Yee Haw\" every time it touches your mouth. YEE HAW! It's completely uncontrollable. YEE HAW YEE HAW! Once you get it in, you're ready to do some Yee Haw kind of shit. For example: Watching NASCAR, Yee Haw. Shootin' your gun, Yee Haw. Cleanin your cowboy boots, Yee Haw. And chuggin a bunch of cheap beer! And a double yee haw! My Yee Haw Chew comes in two distinct flavors: Original Yee Haw, and Yee Haw Rollin' Coal\u2122. Made with real bits of coal! If you chew it long enough, you'll make diamonds! Haha, just kiddin'. Diamonds are formed at high temperatures and pressure over 87 miles in the Earth's mantle. And take anywhere 1 to 7 billion years to form! Ya dummy. My chew is made of three natural ingredients; Chew, gasoline, and molasses! Giving you, the moistest chew you've ever had! And also, the thickest, richest spit you've ever had. Yee Haw Chew, for the Yee Haw, in you.\n\nYee Haw Chew contains Yee Haw chemicals not suitable for coon dogs or children under the age of Yee Haw.\n\n----\n\nYEE HAW!\n\nYou yee, and then you haw. It's easy. West Virginia Dad here, and thanks to the unbelievable success of my Yee Haw Chew, I'm here to bring you- THREE NEW FLAVORS! Heh. NUMBER ONE: Wintermean. It's like wintergreen but meaner. Listerine, Nicotine, and CHEW all bottled up into one. It's gonna feel like you just brushed your teeth! But since it's chew, it has the exact opposite effect. So, still brush your teeth regularly okay? NUMBER TWO: Buckshot. I cut open an entire box of shotgun shells and poured the contents into my chew- giving it a sweet and spicy kind of flavor! Do not chew this near an open flame, there is real gunpowder in here. It will blow your face off. YEE HAW! NUMBER THREE: Mountain Chew. Dale came into me in my dream and said \"Caleb, I want you to soak your chew in Mountain Dew\" I looked at him and said, \"Dale, is that even possible?\" And he looked at me, and said \"Trust me- Put the dew, in the chew.\" I said, \"Dale, I'll trust any words that pass through that beautiful moustache of yours.\" So when I woke up, I made the best chew that's ever been made! You don't even need a spit cup for this! The spit becomes Mountain Dew, ya' just drink it. It's so good. Now, I'm gonna show you how to properly put Yee Haw Chew in your mouth! Yee Haw Chew, for the yee haw, in you... YEE HAW! ;&gt;\n",
