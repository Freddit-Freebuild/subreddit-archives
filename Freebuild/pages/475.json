There was a point one time where I was typing something out and then I snapped back and backspaced it, You guys can tell me whether or not I have a moment, either in the server or on discord. In my opinion I think my self loath shit has lowered quite a bit. And earlier in the day I PM'd Zelda: \"why did you look up to me blah blah\" cause I was legit curious, that's probably a 2% chance of when I 'self loath' when before I did it like 20/30%. While others can disagree, I respect whatever your opinion may be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Context behind the PM is in Other down below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n###Inactiveness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy life has been a little hectic recently, My dad lost his job, I'm having some depression here and there, And my homework and stuff, there's just been a lot in my hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, it's been a bit better so I have at least some time back on Freddit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\n\n\n###The new app thread/real talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI may apply. May or may not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it would be pretty cool to be an admin and or head-moderator, There's more jobs you need to handle. Mod is okay for me, but with something even above that, It gets a bit difficult. You have quite a few priorities, you gotta be on 24/7, be very aware, etc etc. I feel bad for Zelda because of all the shit he has to do lol\n\n\n\n\nViewing staff channel a lot is also one of them\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't view staff channel too often, but I really should if I'm a staff member lol\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***The \"real talk\" part*** (sort of connected to the app thread part)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI try to be the peaceful one even though some people on Freddit piss me off because of something they said or something they did. And then they are all like 'lmao soda chill' or 'wow soda fun ruiner' or 'wow soda spammed ban' or some shitty joke like that even though all I am \"\"trying\"\" to do is go by what me as a staff does, Some people don't even point out shit. I have to do it. Even though it's just a damn \"virtual lego server\", I really put my heart into it because well, I love the community, and I love you guys, I try to enforce the rules, and yes I can be a bit too serious about them sometimes, That's my bad, but it's mainly because it's the rules, and I try to let it be known in every way. Sometimes people spam chat, they flood discord with emotes, they spam the \"\"\"ALL STAR LYRICS IN DISCORD CHAT cough\"\"\", anyways, point is I try to do my best at being staff on here, I don't want anybody to be mad at me or don't want anybody to be an enemy with me, I try to make people happy on here, ***And if someone wants to make any input in the comments, I am all ears.\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n\n###Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZelda has looked up to me before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's really surprising that someone like me would be looked up to by someone who was going to be a future Freddit admin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's oddly and awesome-ly (if that's even a word) interesting to know that some dude you have never met in-person actually looked up to a dude who plays Minecraft with a group of players lmao\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually don't know what I ever did to make Zelda look up to me. But I appreciate him and I thank him, I've never had that before, so it's a first for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###The past\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I know I have brought this up before, but I just wanna explain once more...\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout my cringy old self and Pres\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was immature, and got salty easily. I had this username called NathanFazbear, which just makes me wanna vomit now, and during those times I was rude, and I did some stupid things.\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe I abused my powers during my old days of being Admin (back when Chris was owner), I said some things to players that most likely made them upset, I was care-free and never worried about anything. Back when we 'trusted' Pres, I would say he's the rudest staff, he gets so salty, he's immature blah blah blah\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole /r/privatefazbear thing was a way to talk about what Pres did/talk shit about him. Shortly afterwards, I was demoted by Pres, and then shit-talked to by Nue, Stick, Poke and Pres. I believe someone else was with me too that one point as well, I think it was... Eh Spulb? I forgot at this point, it was like a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also a time I think when Chris banned me...? I've forgotten at this point, and then Chris like griefed and tookover Ubinox's server and banned me and Ubi, some shit like that. I forgot what it was for though. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut anyway back on topic, I was kind of like a mini Spurr/Faz basically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n\n###Serious Talk..?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreddit has changed my life, and that must sound like a huge cliche, but it actually did. I met new people who are amazing as ever, and while being on Freddit I learned some things here and there, Because of Freddit, I literally changed my whole deminer (whatever its spelled), If I never joined Freddit, I'd still be the immature person I was before. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo thank you guys, and even though Chris did some really bad shit, I wanna say thank you to Chris for creating Freddit and it's main concept, you did a good job and you created a, decent community lol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Ranting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOooh boy, you can easily ignore this part because it's not that important to the post but I just wanted to add it in anyway:\n\n\n\n\n\nJAFC. JAFC is a self-centered, self-righteous cunt, who deleted the worlds for so called \"\"\"\"\"\"PEOPLE HATING HIM AND DISRESPECTING HIM\"\"\"\"\"\" which is the most retarded reason I could ever think of. When literally no one but one person hated him. That's like saying \"yeah well my friend said my opinion sucks so im going to sneak over to his house and stab him\" Like that makes about as much as zero sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJAFC needs to learn some common sense. Me and him were okay with each other, as he said I was the rational one, but now he literally fucking deleted shit that I loved, I really don't think something like that could still make us 'so called buddy pal chums'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n###Friends\n\n\n\n\n\nZelda and Leaf. zelda and leaf are the best fucking people in the entire world, they light up my day and even though Zelda can be a bit rude to me at times, He apologizes in the end and I know he never really means it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf is funny and draws porn. What else do I have to say ? /s /s\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf is a chill dude, even though he can make small little jokes like 'soda fuck me' blah blah he's still a cool person and he's fun to hang with just like Zelda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZen, Stick, Sven, Zoo, Ryan, Steam, and all the rest. Thank you. So, so so much from the bottom of my heart, now I know I already thanked you guys up there in 'Players' but, I still feel like it is needed.\n\nZoo - Zoo has taught me some things during my time as staff, He has been a great friend, he's always been the boss type of the server, He's the type of fuckin guy that if you step one foot on his turf, you will regret it if you ever do it again. Thank you Zoo, for everything. Even being an owner on Freddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOO MAN***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZen - You, you make me laugh a lot, you are so fun to hang around with, You are trans (was it non-binary? Tbh I don't even know anymore) and you are proud of it, and that's what I like about you, you don't give a fuck about what people think or say. and you were always the type of staff that was always strict and was kind of like Zoo in a way, Strict, a boss, A kind person, a funny person, and a caring one too. Still remember the day you joined as Lahser haha good ol' times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\n\nStick - funniest fucking dude I've ever met, the oldest Freddit player along side Nue, Poke, etc etc, Stick is my life. I remember the olden days back then, Stick would come on practically everyday, ~~which is a rare occurance now stick stICK JOIN MORE OFTEN STICK~~\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStick is a fucking memelord, a meMELORD wHO THE FUCK DOESN'T LIKE HIM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSven - the hoster, the second owner himself, The one who bought Freddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nayowhaddup my nigga\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for keeping Freddit alive for this long, kind of surprising that you can handle it all lmao in a good way though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd say if someone else was a hoster of Freddit, I'd say it would be dead rn and offline\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are keeping Freddit alive and I just wanna say thank you for that and thank you for improving Freddit to what it is now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers - You guys are awesome honestly, I love playing with you all and on the discord, truly means something to me. Some of us have a lot in common, and some of us don't. But either way I wouldn't give you guys up for the world. Every single one of you impacted on my life, you have built such great things, you have made me laugh, if NONE of you were here rn, Freddit quite possibly wouldn't even be a thing. So thank you. So much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***I just wanna go ahead and put this out there, When I say stuff like 'fuck you' or something like 'calm the fuck down', I never mean it in a mean way honestly. Now, if I did tick someone off recently, I would like to thoroughly apologise, I never actually mean to intend harm, and even if I did something or said something to you regarding rules / spam, I only do that because I care for the server and for you guys I guess you could say, I only try to warn because sometimes I don't know what to do other than warn, or just because I... Well...***\n\n\n\n\n***Zoo has told me to rationalize with some people if they do something, like make a small convo with them about what they did, if someone makes a penis, I ask them to remove it, if they don't it can be something to take action for. If someone spams and I ask them to stop and they keep going, I will do something about it. (Which kind of leads me to my last topic)***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***So ever since Zoo taught me that, I always second thought. So thank you Zoo.***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just wanna address this before finishing this off, I have told people to stop doing such and such multiple times, and they don't really stop. They try to find their way around it. I'd like to make it clear that yes I do take things a bit too serious sometimes like I said, but I am just trying to abide by the rules and hopefully make it clear that they should stop and not do it again if it's in the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\nAnyways thats all I wanted to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###If anybody has any questions or comments about some things I said in this post, please speak up about it. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Soda",

There was a point one time where I was typing something out and then I snapped back and backspaced it, You guys can tell me whether or not I have a moment, either in the server or on discord. In my opinion I think my self loath shit has lowered quite a bit. And earlier in the day I PM&amp;#39;d Zelda: &amp;quot;why did you look up to me blah blah&amp;quot; cause I was legit curious, that&amp;#39;s probably a 2% chance of when I &amp;#39;self loath&amp;#39; when before I did it like 20/30%. While others can disagree, I respect whatever your opinion may be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Context behind the PM is in Other down below)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Inactiveness&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life has been a little hectic recently, My dad lost his job, I&amp;#39;m having some depression here and there, And my homework and stuff, there&amp;#39;s just been a lot in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it&amp;#39;s been a bit better so I have at least some time back on Freddit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The new app thread/real talk&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may apply. May or may not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it would be pretty cool to be an admin and or head-moderator, There&amp;#39;s more jobs you need to handle. Mod is okay for me, but with something even above that, It gets a bit difficult. You have quite a few priorities, you gotta be on 24/7, be very aware, etc etc. I feel bad for Zelda because of all the shit he has to do lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Viewing staff channel a lot is also one of them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t view staff channel too often, but I really should if I&amp;#39;m a staff member lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;quot;real talk&amp;quot; part&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (sort of connected to the app thread part)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to be the peaceful one even though some people on Freddit piss me off because of something they said or something they did. And then they are all like &amp;#39;lmao soda chill&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;wow soda fun ruiner&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;wow soda spammed ban&amp;#39; or some shitty joke like that even though all I am &amp;quot;&amp;quot;trying&amp;quot;&amp;quot; to do is go by what me as a staff does, Some people don&amp;#39;t even point out shit. I have to do it. Even though it&amp;#39;s just a damn &amp;quot;virtual lego server&amp;quot;, I really put my heart into it because well, I love the community, and I love you guys, I try to enforce the rules, and yes I can be a bit too serious about them sometimes, That&amp;#39;s my bad, but it&amp;#39;s mainly because it&amp;#39;s the rules, and I try to let it be known in every way. Sometimes people spam chat, they flood discord with emotes, they spam the &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;ALL STAR LYRICS IN DISCORD CHAT cough&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, anyways, point is I try to do my best at being staff on here, I don&amp;#39;t want anybody to be mad at me or don&amp;#39;t want anybody to be an enemy with me, I try to make people happy on here, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if someone wants to make any input in the comments, I am all ears.\u00a0 \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zelda has looked up to me before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s really surprising that someone like me would be looked up to by someone who was going to be a future Freddit admin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s oddly and awesome-ly (if that&amp;#39;s even a word) interesting to know that some dude you have never met in-person actually looked up to a dude who plays Minecraft with a group of players lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;#39;t know what I ever did to make Zelda look up to me. But I appreciate him and I thank him, I&amp;#39;ve never had that before, so it&amp;#39;s a first for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The past&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I know I have brought this up before, but I just wanna explain once more...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About my cringy old self and Pres&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was immature, and got salty easily.

(Which kind of leads me to my last topic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So ever since Zoo taught me that, I always second thought. So thank you Zoo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Players&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanna address this before finishing this off, I have told people to stop doing such and such multiple times, and they don&amp;#39;t really stop. They try to find their way around it. I&amp;#39;d like to make it clear that yes I do take things a bit too serious sometimes like I said, but I am just trying to abide by the rules and hopefully make it clear that they should stop and not do it again if it&amp;#39;s in the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways thats all I wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;If anybody has any questions or comments about some things I said in this post, please speak up about it. Thanks.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Soda&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If yes, elaborate how** (discord, skype, etc):\n\n**Future activity** (how active you'll be in the near future):\n\n**Prior experience:**\n\n**Notable skills:**\n\n**What are your plans for when you become staff?:**\n\n**In what ways can you help the server once you get staff?:**\n\n**What Minecraft staff commands do you know beforehand?:**\n\n**Why should you be staff?** (This is a more personal question. Just say your peace here without having to follow parameters.):\n\n---\n\nOk. Those were the parameters you must follow.\n\nAlso, a reminder! **All apps will be read regardless if you got accepted or not, regardless if someone replied to it!** We will all read each app carefully, so put your work into making a good one.\n\nTake some time if you want, this megathread will be up for a while.\n\n**Good luck to y'all.**",

It's only fair if you let me do it on this sub.**\n\nAs many of you know, he posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReversalHub/comments/60ep5a/the_real_monster/) shit calling me a monster because of things that other people did, things I never did, things Sven did, and other shit.\n\nWell I replied to him, when he said I manipulated JAFC &amp; Psy (which is total bullshit, all I did was talk to JAFC and tell him that the right move was to give us the maps, but if he didnt want to give us the maps, he can do it anyways - I gave him an option, and I NEVER talked to Psy about the maps, asking for them),\n\nHe says I've insulted him while his posts always call me shit, from \"egotistical maniac\" to \"the real monster\" to other shit, if anyone here is bullying it's him with his constant insults.\n\nHe also said Freddit leaked personal information (which is a COMPLETE LIE, what the fuck did we fucking leak, you're bullshitting) and said that Freddit asked 4 chan (NO SVEN was going to do that, but EVERYONE on Freddit told Sven **not to**. we fucking helped you.)\n\nSo I answered that to his post. **He says get he fuck out of this thread and bans me**. No reason.\n\nHe then **deletes my fucking post that was exposing what he was bullshitting**, and goes on a rampage deleting everything I commented. **That's fucking censorship, ladies and gentlemen, that's manipulating people**.\n\nHe's hiding the truth, he's preventing me from commenting what ACTUALLY happened so he can manipulate people with his bullshit stories.\n\n#If he removes this post, he'll just be proving my point.\n\nHe's removing everything I post, **don't ever fucking believe him. He's capable of deleting people's shit to hide the truth**.\n\nStay awoken, Reversal. This might get taken down by him because he doesn't want you to know I got censored.\n\nFarewell.\n\n**Proof about my claims, because I won't be like him and just throw shit without evidence**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/OdwrX\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/KdHxP\n\nDo not let him manipulate you.\n\n---\n\n**END OF POST**\n\n---\n\nGuess what happens to that post? **It gets fucking deleted by Waving**, once again censoring me so people don't know I was censored.\n\nHe then says I did the same to him (**completly fucking lie - I've never deleted his appeals**) and I had banned him in the past (because he fucking broke a SHIT TON of rules on the server, while I broke 0 on theirs).\n\n---\n\nWhat he does? He removes all my shit again and he bans me again. JAFC has tried to unban me, but he keeps ignoring him and banning him again.\n\nHe also said\n\n&gt;I'm only trying to protect Psy and JAFC from you, I know what fucked up shit you can do by bringing people against people.\n\neven though he's hiding what happened from Psy and from JAFC, to manipulate them.

Please stay civil.\n Please don't just comment insults or just say that what we did was bad and we shouldn't be given a chance. State reasons.**\n\n\n(JAFC) I tried to explain before that this was all my fault but nobody seemed to listen and just assumed this was all because waving \u2018manipulated me\u2019. Keep in mind that us directing people to Reversal was mostly so they could just get their builds back. \n\n\n(Psy) In the beginning, I focused on the least harm that we could do. I wanted people to have their builds.. It was all good after that today. We got most of the schematics back, the maps were restored, etc. I tried as hard as I could to have you guys trust us again, until the logs came out.\n\n\n(JAFC) Look, I\u2019m really sorry about what happened. If you want to blame anyone for this, blame me. If you only want to unban one of us, unban Psy. This is all my fault and I was completely in the wrong. But I want to try to make things right if I can. I really do. Please, give us another chance. Keep in mind that Woger also planned all of her attacks (and Waving did too) and they advertised as well. They got another chance, and Woger is a member of the community now, isn\u2019t she? Even you\u2019ve used her as an example before as someone who changed. \n\n\n(Psy) And speaking of other chances, I know I\u2019ve lost all of your trusts for me. I SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY, seriously regret doing all of this shit, from even accepting JAFC to do the attack, to still accepting it even after I was asked if we should get things over with by just dealing with it without ruining the server. I ruined a much anticipated RP completely by supporting JAFC in removing the worlds, and now the progress is reverted back a whole month. If by any means I am unbanned, I do not want OP. Nor a staff rank. Heck, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be worthy of those two for eternity. What I ask for is to simply have a chance, become unbanned, and start off with the [User] rank. No special perms, nothing. I\u2019ll have to start all over. I still have a chance, I have rarely gotten any \u201csecond chances\u201d as I had not done that much to warrant such a strong punishment. My reputation and trust is ruined, and I would like to take the blame for that. However I think I do not deserve this bad of a punishment, one leveled as much as Waving. I might have hurt everyone\u2019s feelings through the logs, but I have never done such terrible things like this before, except for some days when I was disrespectful or griefing.\n\n\n\n\n (Both) We\u2019re both extremely sorry for what we did, and we just want to try to make things right. We greatly regret with all that we can for destroying the server, ruining users\u2019 and staff\u2019s feelings, and overall breaking the functionality of the server and the server itself. So please give us one more chance.  If you have any questions, please talk to us in the comments. \nThank you for reading.\n\n\t\n\nSincerely,\n\nJAFC and Psy.\n",
