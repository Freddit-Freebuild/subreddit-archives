The removal of this post will negate that.\n\nSo here I am, Deep End, ex-co-head-admin[+] of Reddit Fweebuild.\n\nLet's create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.\n\n#Contention 1: \"\"\"\"Pineapple on Pizza\"\"\"\"\n\nPutting pineapple on pizza had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit's pizza topping combos were just fluff. Pepperoni-Co-Mushroom[+] or whatever. Basically all of the pizza toppings were fucking useless until bacon where you would have tasty flavors.\n\nMoving on from the flavor flaws, the toppings themselves have never been practical.\n\nI've seen 2 good topping combos. Chicken+Onion and Bacon+Mushroom.\n\nPineapple - Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn't be allowed to run pizza parlors.\n\nSausage - A fucking meat with a taste smaller than spurr's dick.\n\nPepperoni - Literal figurehead. Pretty much a poster boy topping but also shitty.\n\nBanana Peppers - Jesus I don't even know where to begin, so I don't know if I can.\n\nBlack Olives - One of the worst pizza topppings I think I've seen anywhere. Imagine a big tasty balloon, except it ruins a pizza if you look at it weirdly.\n\nKeep in mind, these are or have been some of the top selling toppings on pizzas. If I was talking about all toppings, things like anchovies would be filling up this post. Alas, I don't have the time for that.\n\n#Contention 2: Server Owners\n\nBolbi - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.\n\nWaluigi - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for your mom.\n\nFor some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Waluigi) has been banned over some stupid grudges. \n\nAm i here to defend Waluigi and Bolbi? No they can eat dicks. Am I here for the toppings then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely retarded. You created \"pizzas\", specifically comprised of soggy crust for regular customers and fucking meaningless sauce combos. All because you're fucking little kids who can't make pizzas in a situation like this with customer convenience in mind.\n\n#Contention 3: Hip Memes\n\nShitposts were, are, and will always be rampant. Is this bad? Not at all. They're made better by the fact that the TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER are the honchos. Even the most trusted users are envious. The leaders flood the chat with their hilarious and maturely refined memes.\n\nYou know who likes reading the bee movie script? Fucking everyone.\n\nThe fan-fictions, while they may be intentionally perfectly written, were pushed as the face of Freddit's comedy. Were they funny? Yes. Because they were edgy, and because they were so over the top. Make a fresh new spin of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Zoo's reborn fanfics.\n\n#Contention 4: Companies\n\nthey're real fuck off. i have over 200 good boy points from inside of TBC.\n\n#Final Contention: \"Guys let's fix things\"\n\nThe staff team is fucking competent. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\nThere's no drama.\n\nI'm glad as fuck!\n\nWhen there is drama, it's normal drama. Someone pulling the strings must not have a stiffy for the drama because it's few and far between.\n\nAny time the staff tries to revise or reform things, they get better.\n\nSpawn is literally god tier.\n\nReformed staff team is literally god tier.\n\nThis was the final proof to me that the staff team, Sven and Zoo in particular, are far more competent than I thought a human being could be. They're so free of ego bias, that I'll actually be amazed if they don't let this post stay up.\n\nTo anyone who's read this, thank you.\n\nFreddit has gone from good to to absolutely. I will be coming back every day from 09:00 to 23:00 EST, and I urge you out there to do the same.\n\nFuck yeah.\n\n~Depend\n\nPs: All of your comics, shows, and stories are interesting and original in every sense of the word.",

The removal of this post will negate that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am, Deep End, ex-co-head-admin[+] of Reddit Fweebuild.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s create some contentions as to why I believe my claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Contention 1: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Pineapple on Pizza&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting pineapple on pizza had little to no merit. For the most part, the ladder of Freddit&amp;#39;s pizza topping combos were just fluff. Pepperoni-Co-Mushroom[+] or whatever. Basically all of the pizza toppings were fucking useless until bacon where you would have tasty flavors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving on from the flavor flaws, the toppings themselves have never been practical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen 2 good topping combos. Chicken+Onion and Bacon+Mushroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pineapple - Actually shit. Text book example on why kids shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to run pizza parlors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sausage - A fucking meat with a taste smaller than spurr&amp;#39;s dick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pepperoni - Literal figurehead. Pretty much a poster boy topping but also shitty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banana Peppers - Jesus I don&amp;#39;t even know where to begin, so I don&amp;#39;t know if I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Black Olives - One of the worst pizza topppings I think I&amp;#39;ve seen anywhere. Imagine a big tasty balloon, except it ruins a pizza if you look at it weirdly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, these are or have been some of the top selling toppings on pizzas. If I was talking about all toppings, things like anchovies would be filling up this post. Alas, I don&amp;#39;t have the time for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Contention 2: Server Owners&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bolbi - dysphoric edgelord kept around for whatever the fuck reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waluigi - old owner, not actually a bad guy, boner for your mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the worst of the two has been consistently unbanned, and the lesser (Waluigi) has been banned over some stupid grudges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am i here to defend Waluigi and Bolbi? No they can eat dicks. Am I here for the toppings then? No fuck them. Both parties are absolutely retarded. You created &amp;quot;pizzas&amp;quot;, specifically comprised of soggy crust for regular customers and fucking meaningless sauce combos. All because you&amp;#39;re fucking little kids who can&amp;#39;t make pizzas in a situation like this with customer convenience in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Contention 3: Hip Memes&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shitposts were, are, and will always be rampant. Is this bad? Not at all. They&amp;#39;re made better by the fact that the TOP STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SERVER are the honchos. Even the most trusted users are envious. The leaders flood the chat with their hilarious and maturely refined memes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know who likes reading the bee movie script? Fucking everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fan-fictions, while they may be intentionally perfectly written, were pushed as the face of Freddit&amp;#39;s comedy. Were they funny? Yes. Because they were edgy, and because they were so over the top. Make a fresh new spin of literally every washed out, over the top, done to the dirt internet joke x5 and then you get Zoo&amp;#39;s reborn fanfics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Contention 4: Companies&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they&amp;#39;re real fuck off. i have over 200 good boy points from inside of TBC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Contention: &amp;quot;Guys let&amp;#39;s fix things&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The staff team is fucking competent.

But when you voice your opinion, someone else with a different take on things might disagree - and you can start discussing the issue.\n\nThat's fine, really. It gets heated up, but you still have freedom of speech. Until, that is, disrespecting and insulting comes to board.\n\n---\n\nA lot of times on Freddit, drama events happen because two people disagree with something, but instead of debating/discussing it rationally, they become very emotional about it, and very tense.\n\nBut they still have freedom of speech - they are welcomed to have opinions and to let their opinions known (we're not going to start opressing opinions).\n\n#So, how do we ensure a debate/discussion between two people doesn't become ballistic?\n\nStepping in and saying \"Oh boy some more drama\" or \"What the fuck are you guys arguing about now\" definetly doesn't. Just take **100% of all the cases that ever happen** and see that ALL of them when someone steps in saying \"oh boy some more spicy drama\" and such it never, ever, helps. Most of the time, it worsens the situation.\n\nThe rules don't cover for it much either; there's no rule that says \"You must stop arguing about a subject if you have different opinions!\" - there is, ofc, don't be salty and the disrespecting one, but that sometimes doesn't do the job and isnt enough.\n\n**Philosophy is the answer**. Actually, it has little to do with philosophy but it is in my philosphy book so whatever\n\nThere's a thing called **informal logic**. You use that shit to debate and to talk about shit. There are some fallacies that you can execute, even if by accident, that makes your logic invalid.\n\n**This is universal** in the world of philosophy - fallacies such as _Ad Hominem_, which is \"Insulting the person instead of his position\" is commonly used via insults.\n\nI think it should be accounted for when you're talking. If everyone keeps these in mind, the debates get a lot less toxic. Let's see what they are.\n\n---\n\n#Important informal fallacies to bear in mind so you dont make them:\n\n---\n\n- **Appeal to the stone** - dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. _(X is absurd.)_\n\n_PERSON A: NotSoBot is a scam and it's tracking our messages!_\n\n_PERSON B: Who? That cool ass discord bot? Nah no way, that's absurd_\n\n- **Ad ignorantiam** (appeal to the ignorance) - saying that since a claim hasn't been proven true, it isn't true - or, ofc, saying that since a claim hasn't been proven false, it isn't false. _(X hasn't been proven false. Therefor, it's true.)_\n\n_PERSON A: IMO, Ass isn't a really good staff._\n\n_PERSON B: You haven't proved he's a bad staff, therefor he's a good staff._\n\n- **Ad hominem** - attacking the person instead of his position _(Person A defends X. Person B attacks Person A instead of X.)_\n\n_PERSON A: Pain is innevitable._\n\n_PERSON B: What do you know about being in pain? You've been happy your whole life!_ - I chose to go with one less obvious _Ad Hominem_ to show its not always saying \"fuck you\" to the dude - PERSON B attacked PERSON A instead of his arguments without insulting or disrespecting. I used this example to show you that Ad Hominem includes these types of refuting logic via using the person instead of the argument, and it also, ofc, includes insulting or disrespecting the person)\n\n- **Appeal to authority** -  where an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it. _(Person A has authority and defends X. Therefor, X is true.)_\n\n_PERSON A: Racism is not ok!_\n\n_PERSON B:  I'm a moderator, therefor when I say racism is ok, then it's because it is ok!_\n\n- **Appeal to Hypocrisy** -  the argument states that a certain position is false or wrong or should be disregarded because its oponent fails to act consistently in accordance with that position. _(Person A defends X. Person A doesn't act accordingly to X. Therefor, X is false.)_\n\n_PERSON A: Being afk is bad._\n\n_PERSON B: He says being afk is bad, but he's also been afk a lot of times - so being afk is not bad!_ - afk could/could not be bad and it does not depend on the person's actions\n\n- **Begging the question** - your conclusion is the same as your argument. _(X. Therefor, X.)_\n\n_PERSON: You're a bad owner because you don't do your job well_ - and not doing your job well makes you a bad owner, and a bad owner is a bad owner because he isn't doing his job well - it's a loop.\n\n- **Cherry picking** - dismissing evidence that disproves your claims and pointing to data that only backs up your claims. _(Person A did X, Y and Z that support my claims, while ignoring A, B and C that doesn't support his claims)_\n\n_PERSON (while leaving out the good things that person did): That person is bad! He has done this, that, and that!_ - Attention - sometimes good things dont make up for the bad things anyway.\n\n- **False dilemma** - narrowing down all the options to a limited ammount, ignoring valid options. _(Either X or Y, while ignoring all the other possibilities)_\n\n_PERSON A: You have done really bad things._\n\n_PERSON B: You are either a bad guy or a good guy. I'm definetly not the bad guy, so I'm a good guy._ - there's a lot of inbetween there that was dismissed.\n\n- **Straw man** - distorting someone's original argument into a similar one (the straw man) and refuting that distorted argument as a way to refute the original argument. _(Person A defends X. Person B distorts X into Y, attacks Y easily and uses as if he's attacking X.)_\n\n_PERSON A: The racism rule should be a little easier on us..._\n\n_PERSON B: If you allow a server to be fully racist you will make it toxic and and uninviting place._ - the original proposal was to make the rule a bit less firm, but Person B distorted into being a proposal about removing the rule completly and allowing full racism.\n\n- **Irrelevant conclusion** (_Ignoratio elenchi_) - having valid arguments but missing the entire point of the discussion. _(Person A defends X. Person B defends Y because of certain arguments. X and Y are unrelated.)_\n\n_On the subject of accidental griefs:_\n\n_PERSON: Griefers destroy builds and there could've been damage that couldn't be repared!_ - completly misses the point of the subject, which is accidental griefs and not griefers in general. The argument is valid but the conclusion misses the point.\n\n- **Snowballing** - one event leads to another event, which leads to another event and on and on exageratedly and out of proportion. _(Person A assumes X leads to Y while exagerating out of porportion)_\n\n_PERSON: If I don't get owner, I will get mad, which will make me take my anger on someone, which will make me break rules, which will cause some controversy if it was acceptable or not, which could end up in my ban, which would make me sad, which would make me disturbed IRL._\n\n---\n\nThis post took me more than an hour to write. I hope you guys read this shit and actually get some sense into your heads when you're debating or discussing something, so drama can actually start getting down - and yes, I will also bear these in mind.\n\nAlright, hugs from the philosophically correct Man.\n\n---\n\n**If you don't understand something, tell me**. This is literally taught at philosophy at my school, so having some questions about it is completly normal.",
