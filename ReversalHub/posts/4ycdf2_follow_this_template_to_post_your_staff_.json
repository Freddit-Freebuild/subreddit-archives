And don&amp;#39;t tell me you haven&amp;#39;t, because then you&amp;#39;ll be lying. It&amp;#39;s happened to all of us, and this is no different. Some people choose to forget, some people choose to linger, and others choose to do whatever possible to gain forgiveness. I&amp;#39;m, unfortunately, part of the latter. It&amp;#39;s unfortunate because it seems nobody would be willing to give me a chance. I&amp;#39;m shut out, neglected, and thought of as the worst human to breathe on this earth. Point is, we all make shitty mistakes that we wish we can take back. This is not different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
