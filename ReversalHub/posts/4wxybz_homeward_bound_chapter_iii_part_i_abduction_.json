Suddenly, Pres came in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell do you want?\" said Dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPres suddenly started shaking Dry. \"Stop. Sending me. Pictures. Of your lame disguises.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're not lame! They're very interesting!\" said Dry. \"And can't you see I'm trying to get off this rock?!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I am too.

Suddenly, the room in Dry's closet lost its gravity. They started to float. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell's happening?!\" said Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How should I know?!\" said Dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of them were pulled by a beam, into the alien airship. What they didn't see, however, was that Zoo was also being picked up into the beam... Pres saw a figure upon arriving. Then he saw 2 more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prepare for departure!\" said the middle figure. The ship suddenly flew off into space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDry got up, looking around. \"What the hell?!\" said Dry. \"If you think that you can just run off with me like that, you are very sadly mistaken. Take us back to the planet Earth!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What are you?\" said Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Calm down, abducted. I am Glaaga Glarg.\" said the middle alien. \"These are my two scientists, Waggo and Globo.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell do you want with us, anyways?!\" said Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why, to study you, of course! After all, you *are* humans, right?\" said Glaaga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What?! HELL NO!\" said Dry. \"Absolutely NOT! We're god damn aliens for god's sake!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then explain THIS!\" said Waggo, showing a picture of Dry's disguise on a gigantic screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I'm NOT HUMAN!\" said Dry. \"Notice how I'm not wearing that now? It's only a disguise! Now I can see why you would be fool-\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"YES, YOU ARE!\" said Waggo. \"Surveillance footage showed you acting EXACTLY like a human!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance footage on the screen showed Dry in public, wearing a disguise. \"I'm still a human.\" said Dry on the surveillance footage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I WAS LYING! I'm a Dryzan! Haven't you ever looked up Dryza?\" said Dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And besides, what does all this crap have to do with ME?!\" said Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're a gopher, aren't you?\" asked Globo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPres facepalmed. \"I AM A GOD DAMN SPACE DEMON, YOU SON OF A-\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to listen to any of your excuses!\" said Glaaga. \"We are taking you to a testing facility on our homeplanet! You will be studied, and experi-\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"K, I've heard enough.\" said Dry, pulling out his Ray Pistol. \"Take us back to Earth or I'll shoot one of you. If you refuse again, I'll shoot another one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NO!\" said Glaaga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDry pulled the trigger, but the aliens dodged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"THAT'S IT!!! SEND THEM INTO OUR CELL SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR HUMANS!!\" said Glaaga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Zoo, who was even more confused than Dry and Pres, suddenly found himself back home. Or was it? The buildings in Reversal City were...not in the right order. All he knew was he was in a suit that had a Z on it. He had a black cape, and a mask on. Zoo frowned, puzzled. He wasn't dressed in his Zooman suit before he regained his senses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sighed, and looked down at the city. Not too far away from his radio that allowed him to listen to conversations, Chris met Sven in an ally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I got two tickets for the new Independance Day movie!\" said Sven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"OH NO!\" said Zooman, gliding down. \"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Chris knew it, Zooman glided into him, then started kicking the **life** out of him. \"YOUR NEFARIOUS PLAN WILL NEVER SUCCEED, CRIMINAL SCUM!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Sven started...glitching? He appeared to be glitching in and out of reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell?!\" said Zooman. Zooman looked around the environment, wondering if he was really where he was. Then he grappled away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on the ship, Pres and Dry were thrown into a cell together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to get the hell out of here!\" said Dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No shit, Sherlock.\" said Pres. \"But we can't just wander around the ship, hoping we'll find someway out.. We need to find a map. It's just like Indiana Jones and his people did in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Search for tresure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, I don't want to hear about Indiana Jones, Pres! That was a boring movie!\" said Dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Have you even watched it?\" asked Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"...That question is irrelevent to the conversation.\" said Dry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, here we are, trapped in a cell, in space, going to some facility where we will never return.\" sighed Pres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah...\" said Dry. \"Okay, let's get out of here.\" Dry got up and easily slipped through the bars, made out of *balloons*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Stupid-ass aliens.\" said Pres, walking out with Dry.",
