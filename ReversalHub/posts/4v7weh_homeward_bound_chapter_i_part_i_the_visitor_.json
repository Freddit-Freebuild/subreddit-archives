Reversal City. The biggest city in Reversal.\" said Noble. \n\n\n\n\n\"Would it be possible to get me and my broken down UFO there with your automobile?\" asked Dry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We do happen to have some rope in our truck.\" said Ebola. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, what are you waiting for, you want me to take you to Globalo World?!

Call me Dry.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing rope, they tied one end of the rope to the UFO, and the other to Dry's wrist. Dry sat in the back of the truck, pulling the UFO with him. \"This.. is so... damn hard!\" said Dry, pulling the UFO towards the car. While driving, Stick and Hom saw the UFO. \"Would you, uh, look at that. Uh, UFO.\" said Stick. \"What a bizarre turn of events.\" said Hom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they arrived at Reversal City, Dry found a wig in the trunk, and put it on himself. \"Hi, I'm a normal man.\" said Dry as he walked into the apartments with Ebola, Noble and Zoo. \"What the hell are we gonna do?\" whispered Zoo. \"It's a god damn ALIEN!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry! We can hide it in one of our apartments.\" said Ebola. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But which one?\" asked Noble. After a long battle of Rock, Paper, Scissors, they came to an agreement.

Dry looked at him. \"Can you say \"E.T Phone Home?\" asked Noble. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"...Screw you.\" said Dry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, E.T Phone Home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Screw you again.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Phone-\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your mama.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Okay, not an E.T.\" said Noble. \"I get it.

Dry was in there, looking like he was imagining where to place objects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the closet.\" explained Noble. \"It's where I keep my clo-\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'll take this space.\" said Dry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wait, what?\" replied Noble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your \"closet\".
