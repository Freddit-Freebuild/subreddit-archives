The server has been since shut down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been on the server?:&lt;/strong&gt; Since Chris had people write applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you played Minecraft for?:&lt;/strong&gt; 4 years (Oct. 2011)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you saw someone grief, what would you do?:&lt;/strong&gt; Griefing would be a serious offense and would result in a ban. They could explain themselves in an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you?:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel like I&amp;#39;m an active person on the server and I just like to help and see what people build (while building pixel art on my own, too) I would like to make the server a better place by getting rid of griefers and helping newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else?:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope you accept my app!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
