Some of you I am not talking to you specifically but i would like ALL of you to read this.\n\n/u/NueSB shouldn't have been banned, it was an accident as stated earlier and he didn't mean it. Why would a good staff member with a good reputation want to \"grief?\" It was a small mistake that was explained. Think before you make decisions.\n\n\nI'm not a POC or Freddit supporter anymore, they are even to me. POC's server isn't even bad at all. Its a salt free environment. But wait POC is a salty butthurt right? Wrong you are all the reason why all this drama exists. He invited the certain users for a reason, because they were the users that wouldn't attack Chris for something he did in the **PAST**. Get over it, it wont freaking kill you and its all pointless. Dont redeem yourselves, just forget about it all ffs.\n\n\n/u/Svensonic. Your a good owner but you need to think about what do for a minute. You've never been on Chris's server so how is it so bad? And whenever people were making cringe, that ban was completely stupid. Think before doing.\n\n\n/u/Noteblockcrew, have some damned respect. You call Hom and Poke a griefer when you don't even know what they did. And there's a reason sometimes for people disliking you and it wont kill you. There not horrible people.\n\n\nDont go to war with the cringers, it was 2 idiotic people who said to troll and abuse the sub. Nothing happened. Watching you all is just getting more and more amusing. \n\n\nChris didn't tell /r/fnafcringe to attack. He was expressing himself to how horrible you all act on a daily basis. No hes not innocent as he does some things that aren't right.\n\n\n /u/FNAFDetective your face isn't ugly and don't take it too hard for what one person did. People will always care.\n\n\nId also like to thank everyone for the fun experience of freddit. It wasnt flawless but I had one hell of a time.",
